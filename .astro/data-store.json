beautiful image galleries with captions:\n\n\u003CImageGallery\n  images={[\n    { src: '/images/sample-1.jpg', alt: 'Sample image 1', caption: 'A beautiful example' },\n    { src: '/images/sample-2.jpg', alt: 'Sample image 2', caption: 'Another great shot' },\n  ]}\n  columns={2}\n/>\n\n## Video Transcript\n\nFor accessibility and SEO, you can add collapsible transcripts:\n\n\u003CVideoTranscript\n  transcript=\"This is an example transcript of your video content.\n\nYou can add the full transcript here, and it will be displayed in a collapsible section that readers can expand if they want to read along or search for specific content.\n\nThis is great for accessibility and helps with SEO too!\"\n/>\n\n## Regular Content\n\nOf course, you can still write regular markdown content with all the beautiful illuminated manuscript styling. The cream background and rich black text create a readable, elegant experience.\n\n### Lists Work Great\n\n- Beautiful typography\n- Responsive images\n- YouTube embeds\n- Image galleries\n- Collapsible transcripts\n\n### So Do Code Blocks\n\n```javascript\nconst greeting = \"Hello, Hobbinomicon!\";\nconsole.log(greeting);\n```\n\nAnd **bold text**, *italic text*, and [links](https://example.com) all look wonderful with the custom styling.","src/content/blog/example-with-media.mdx","c8c5060d2a3a66ea","example-with-media.mdx","characters/character-template",{"id":54,"data":56,"body":65,"filePath":66,"digest":67,"legacyId":68,"deferredRender":18},{"title":57,"description":58,"pubDate":59,"heroImage":60,"category":61,"tags":62,"featured":18,"draft":19},"Character
