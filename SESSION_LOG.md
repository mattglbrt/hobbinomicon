## 2026-07-21 — YouTube description pass: 190 updated, two bugs fixed, old pipeline retired

Resumed the description footer pass that stalled 07-15 at 22 videos. **190 updated this run, 0 errors** — the full priority set (playlisted + game-mapped, 160 videos) is now covered. 65 non-priority videos remain, blocked only by the 10,000/day API quota.

**Two bugs found and fixed before running anything live** (`35050cf`, `scripts/update-descriptions.cjs`):

1. *Rewrite loop.* Videos whose original description was empty ended up footer-only. The script sent `"\n\n" + footer`, YouTube stripped the leading whitespace, so the read-back never equalled the desired string and the content-based skip never fired. 14 videos were being rewritten every pass at 50 quota units each — a permanent tax on a quota-bound job. Fixed by emitting the bare footer when there's no body.
2. *Duplicate link block.* 232 of 271 videos still carried the pre-footer block (`---` / `🌐 Website & Blog: https://hobbinomicon.com` / `---`) above their hashtags, so the new footer was landing beneath it as a second, un-UTM'd link block. Matt chose to strip it in the same pass. The regex requires the site URL to match, so a bare `---` used as a separator in real body text can't be eaten; verified 232/232 clean against the 07-15 backup before any live write.

**`push-descriptions.cjs` retired** (`79a711a`). STATUS had it ranked as the #1 next action, but it was the wrong tool: it matched files in `descriptions/` to videos by *fuzzy title similarity*, and its one remaining backlog item — "Almost done" (`zFFKXkdD3js`) — resolved to `Almost_done_with_Dolmenwood_Breggle_Mini`'s description. Short titles make that failure common, not rare. `update-descriptions.cjs` matches on video ID and supersedes it, so the script and its npm alias are gone (git history retains them). The gitignored `descriptions/` corpus (232 files) and `descriptions_pushed.json` are now unused but left on disk.

Verification: spot-checked `bWV0v1u65es` against the live API post-run — legacy block gone, single correct footer.

**Artifacts**
- `scripts/backups/descriptions-backup-2026-07-21T15-00-00.json` — 271 live snippets, taken immediately pre-run. The only undo. (Backups are gitignored.)
- `scripts/update-descriptions.cjs` — the surviving, sole description writer.
- `CLAUDE.md` — new "YouTube description footer pass" section: backup first, quota math, priority ordering, 7-day token expiry, and a note that similarly-named `backfill-descriptions.js` is unrelated (it fills MDX frontmatter from transcripts).
- `package.json` — added `update-descriptions` + `backup-descriptions` aliases, dropped `push-descriptions`.
- `scripts/youtube-auth.cjs` — pointed at the surviving script in two places.

**Still open:** the last 65 descriptions need one more quota day. The refresh token expires 07-22, so re-auth first. That token churn is now the recurring cost of leaving the OAuth app unverified — this session is the argument for promoting that task. `SESSION_LOG.md` and `STATUS.md` remain untracked in git from yesterday's install.

## 2026-07-21 — Everyway organization standard installed

STATUS.md, this log, `/wrap` `/orient` commands added; standard footer appended to CLAUDE.md. Known stale spot: README says Astro 5 / Tailwind 3 — repo is on Astro 6 since 03-24.
