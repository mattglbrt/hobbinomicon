This example post demonstrates how to use all the rich media features available in The Hobbinomicon.

## YouTube Video Embed

You can easily embed YouTube videos in your posts:

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Example Video" />

## Image Galleries

Create beautiful image galleries with captions:

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    { src: '/images/sample-1.jpg', alt: 'Sample image 1', caption: 'A beautiful example' },
    { src: '/images/sample-2.jpg', alt: 'Sample image 2', caption: 'Another great shot' },
  ]}
  columns={2}
/>

## Video Transcript

For accessibility and SEO, you can add collapsible transcripts:

<VideoTranscript
  transcript="This is an example transcript of your video content.

You can add the full transcript here, and it will be displayed in a collapsible section that readers can expand if they want to read along or search for specific content.

This is great for accessibility and helps with SEO too!"
/>

## Regular Content

Of course, you can still write regular markdown content with all the beautiful illuminated manuscript styling. The cream background and rich black text create a readable, elegant experience.

### Lists Work Great

- Beautiful typography
- Responsive images
- YouTube embeds
- Image galleries
- Collapsible transcripts

### So Do Code Blocks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, Hobbinomicon!";
console.log(greeting);
```

And **bold text**, *italic text*, and [links](https://example.com) all look wonderful with the custom styling.
