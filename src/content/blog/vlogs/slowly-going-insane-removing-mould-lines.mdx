## Transcript

How many hours of my life have I done this? But I have filed so many mold lines. I've dulled the back side of the X-Acto blade. This is ridiculous.

Last one. Last one. All 90 done. 15 hours later. They're ready to be glued together. Jesus. Not really. 15 for the whole thing, counting the bases. This has been brutal. But they are ready to be glued. Ready to be painted. I was hoping to have a much cooler video for you today, but instead I've got this.

Very satisfying to see all this—the last, at this point, 4 days of work, long hours in. Got all these guys built. I did touch up this horn over here because somehow it got like thick. I don't really understand how it got thick, but I cut it down to make it more in line.

So this is going to be a fast one, guys. It's almost midnight. I didn't want to miss it. A lot of hobby time has been happening. But it's been a lot of hobby time getting to this point. Every single piece you see here has the mold lines trimmed. There's not a single mold line in either one of these tubs. Actually, there's going to be some mold lines on these because I haven't done the resin ones yet. And realizing that is like a kick in the gut. But I'm going to knock that out, post this video, go to bed, wake up tomorrow, get everybody based, and then actually start painting.

One thing I do want to talk about and add is we have a Discord. Like everybody else has got a Discord. But tonight there was like four or five of us hanging out, hobbying together, talking through it. It made the last like 3 hours of the goblin assembly not suck so bad. So if you want to join our Discord, link is in the description below. We mostly just hang out, post pictures of the stuff we're making. More than welcome to join.
