## Never In My Life

Never in my life have I done this. I've filed so many mold lines I've dulled the back side of an X-Acto blade. This is ridiculous.

## Last One

Last one. Last one! All 90 done. 15 hours later—counting the bases—they're ready to be glued together.

This has been brutal. But they're ready to be painted.

## Four Days of Work

Very satisfying to see all this—the last 4 days of long hours. Got all these guys built. Touched up a horn that somehow got thick.

Almost midnight. Didn't want to miss posting. A lot of hobby time has been happening.

## Every. Single. Piece.

Every single piece you see here has the mold lines trimmed. Not a single mold line in either one of these tubs.

Actually... there's going to be some mold lines on the resin ones because I haven't done those yet. Realizing that is like a kick in the gut.

Going to knock that out, post this video, go to bed, wake up tomorrow, get everybody based, and then actually start painting.

## Discord Shoutout

Tonight there were 4-5 of us hanging out on Discord, hobbying together, talking through it. Made the last 3 hours of goblin assembly not suck so bad.

If you want to join the Discord, link is in the description. We mostly just hang out and post pictures of stuff we're making.
