## The Marbled Covers Update

It's been about 48 hours and our book covers are all dry from hanging. You can see how curled up they are—I've got to take all these down and stack them in my press with a little jig that evenly disperses the pressure. I'll leave them sitting in that for a couple of days.

I also finished the actual layout of the book in InDesign for my wife. That's where most of my time went.

## The Base Situation

When I was going to put the Trench Crusade stuff away, I realized what a pain it was going to be without bases. So I pushed them all towards one end of the table.

Then I remembered—when I printed bases for the Trench Pilgrims, I printed four different plates full just because I knew I'd need more eventually. Found them!

## Why Legends Games Bases

All my bases are from Legends Games. They have ones with more detail, but I think these are called the plain ones—and you've seen how they look on my Trench Pilgrims. In my opinion, they have just enough detail to actually add to the model, but not enough that it takes forever to paint. That's where I want to be.

I also really like the magnet style. I just think it looks cool.

## Printing Tips

The only thing you should know: they don't come pre-supported. What you do is pop them on the build plate and rotate them 45 degrees so they look like this. Then I just use Lychee auto supports.

I didn't have any misprints. I printed all the 32mm, the 25mm, 40s, 50s, 60s—nothing failed at 45-degree angle with auto supports.

## The Magnetizing Process

I stuck my finger in my old paint water cup and splashed some water on the magnets. The reason? Superglue works better with moisture—it serves as an accelerant.

I have a glove on because for the first time in months I don't have superglue on my fingers. Just trying to keep it that way a little longer. Honestly at this point it feels weird to not have superglue all over my fingers.

## The Metal Tray Secret

When ACR went out of business, I literally bought every one of these metal trays they had for a couple bucks each. They've all been used up over the years. My wife always gets mad because I never let her use them for baking—I've always used them for moving armies because they're very ferrous. These things stick way more than even a Magnarack does.

## One More Tip

With this much superglue drying and hardening, it's going to make a lot of that white dust residue. I'm going to put this inside a cardboard box and close it so I don't get white dust all over.

## The Week Ahead

Getting kind of low on magnets, so I'm only doing these tonight. Tomorrow I actually glue the figures to the bases.

Then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday is all about painting just two models—Silena and my objective for the painting competition on Sunday. Wish me luck!
