## Getting Past the Intimidation

Let me show you how easy it is to start playing Necromunda because it can be kind of crazy if you go to GW's website and see all the rulebooks.

## Munda Manager (Yaktribe)

First site is Munda Manager. It makes it super easy to build your gangs and keep track of them during a campaign. It has all the rules built into the logic of the app—a free-to-use website that works on mobile devices too.

You can see how quickly I can make my ganger. It double-checks to make sure I'm not breaking any rules and keeps track of all my credits and equipment. It takes out all the guesswork and needing like 50 different books to build your gang.

## Necro Raw

The other resource is Necro Raw. It's similar to Wahapedia—just has all the rules and citations in one place. Easy to search.

This is good because I do plan on actually buying all the books, but this tells me specifically all the rules in one place.

## No More Intimidation

As a new player, I was super intimidated to get back into Necromunda. Now I'm not anymore. These two free resources make it accessible.
