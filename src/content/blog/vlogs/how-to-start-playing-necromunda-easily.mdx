## Transcript

I'm going to show you how easy it is to start playing Necromunda because it can be kind of crazy if you go to GW's website and see all the rulebooks.

First site is Yaktribe. What it does is it makes it super easy to build your gangs and keep track of them during the campaign. It has all the rules in like the logic of the app, which is a free-to-use website that works on mobile devices too. So you can see how quickly I can make my ganger. It double checks to make sure I'm not breaking any rules and it keeps track of all my credits and everything I have equipped. It's really cool. It takes out all the guesswork and having to need like 50 different books to build your gang.

And then the other one is Necro Vox. And this one is similar to Wahapedia where it just has all the rules and the citations, which is good because I do plan on actually going and buying all the books. But this tells me specifically all the rules in one place, easy to search.

As a new player, I was just super intimidated to get back into it, and I'm not anymore.
