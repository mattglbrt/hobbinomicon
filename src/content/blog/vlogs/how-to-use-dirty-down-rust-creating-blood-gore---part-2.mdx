## Transcript

All right, everybody has been matted down and sealed. We have the Dirty Down Rust. We're going to do a section at a time. Heat gun. Come in here. Should not put it on wood. We're going to keep it. Man, this stuff smells like—literally smells like cappy. We're going to hit the rest of it just because. Just because.

All right. Heat gun again. Almost forgotten here. And I'm not going to spend a ton of time on that. Should have been there. That's just for somebody looks through, it'll catch their little eye.

All right. So now want to water on my brush. All right, this is just water. Just dab dab dab dab dab dab dab dab dab. Dab it everywhere. Back in the pot. Stippling. Stippling. Get a little bit wet. Reactivate some areas. Reactivation. Heat gun.

All right, we're pretty much done with the actual product. We're going to seal this back up. So, I get reactivation going. And we're taking this when we get it wet like this, we're just taking it off the very tips of the chain links. Keep going. Boom.

Going to let the rest of this dry naturally on its own. Mithril Silver again. Palette. Dry brush. Work it into the bristles. We're going to make sure we want to make sure we have a lot off of the brush. So, I'm using the sponge. Really making sure that a lot of that's off. And now just very lightly that's accumulated.

All right, there we go. Sky is done. Uh, we'll rim the base. Oh, wait. No, he's not done. I'm just playing. Forgot to do the front. So, so they add—uh, this we're going to be very strategic. We're going to put this in here and we're going to let it go like pretty pretty nap. It's not dry. There we go.

All right, it's time. Blood for the Blood God. Whoa. And down the legs because he's just been getting clapped. And also, this is going to help cover up all that we didn't paint.

All right, so this is where it's going to get cool. Ooh, glue. Universal soda pop. Ah, universal adhesive. Oh, I squeeze it too hard. Squeeze it too hard. Come on. Stop coming out. Oh, no. This thing is pressure. Sure, we got it. We're capping it. That's what it is. That's going to—that's a problem for another day.

All right. So, now back to the brush we don't care about. And we're going to do Blood Angels Contrast. Shake it up. Um, I'm going to use a brush like—our I'm not touching that glue with this yet. I'm just getting the paint on the thing. Getting a lot of paint in there.

All right, getting that brush off. Okay, so now I have this brush that I don't care too much about. Look. See, it's already—it's already getting there. Boy, I just put my finger in it. What is this on our page? What is this on our page?

Okay, we're going to take this globule. Just pop pop. Throw that lid back on it. All right. Finger glove. Now it's just on the tip of my glove. And I'm just going to swipe it on the wheel. You got to think fast sometimes. And we want these thin strands of gunk because we want it to be a little bit over the top, right? That's disgusting. And it covers up, most important, it covers up how little we spent on the paint job.

Boom. Yuck. For the Blood God. I'm sorry the angle on this is terrible. I was trying to not get to this point. But that UHU glue is like pretty much coming out already dry. And we're just going to stipple this in. We're just going to come in. I'm going to stick my finger in the pot. Stippling with a glove. Jeez, this is ridiculous. This looks—I don't know.

I think that's all we're going to do. That's—this is a little bit comical at this point. A little bit too far, but it looks disgusting. Um, if you're into that, there we go. I think I took it a little bit too far for my personal taste, but hey, it's Trey's head. That's what it's about. Gore. Utterly ridiculous.
