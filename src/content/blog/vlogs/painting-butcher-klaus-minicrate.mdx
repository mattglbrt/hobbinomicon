## Setting Up

Butcher time, baby! I magnetized the bottom of his base and have a very scientific setup to stay in frame—I drew a box on paper so I know when I'm staying in frame.

I've decided to dig into these Army Painter speed paints because if I'm not going all out, I want to perfect a speed painting approach.

## The Mold Line Disaster

I cleaned the Butcher up, but I just saw these mold lines on his hand. Very unfortunate because I don't have time. We're going to have to paint over them and come back to sand them off later. And the cane—oh my god. Did I even clean this guy off? But the show must go on.

## Base Coating the Reds

Red's done! Man, this Angel's Contrast Red is just magic. I don't like how the shoulder pads look from the tea staining—contrast over big flat surfaces can be rough. I'll touch up all the red with Methven Red.

I'm going to get everything base coated before coming back to finish colors.

## Working Through the Colors

For browns, I used Satchel Brown on the sack and gloves. I hit all the skulls with Bony Matter and used Carmen Dragon on the berries and bows—it's pretty bright but looks sick.

For the gold, I just don't have it in me to do non-metallic metal to try to get him done. Gold's in! We're not going to win any awards with it, but it looks good. Just trying to get a cool looking tabletop model.

## The Speed Paint Lineup

- **Forest Green** for the greenery
- **Brownish Decay** (my favorite paint color) for the pine cone grenade things and cornucopia
- **Battleship Gray** for the beard
- **Slaughter Red** for the cloak—wanted something different from the armor

## Fixing the Cloak Disaster

On the cloak, I loaded up the brush and... oh god. No. At least I got it on camera. I'll leave it alone and fix anything later. I went back in with Epson Red overall to fix the water marks.

## The Final Details

For the glasses, I used Tidal Wave—glazed several layers, then mixed with white for the reflection. Pure white on the actual reflection. His skin is Kislev Flesh with a little red on the nose.

I went back over all the white parts with my tiny brush to reestablish the white. On the skulls, I glazed in Kislev Flesh at about 50/50 to add polish.

## The Result

For a one-day painting, I love how this turned out! Obviously I'd like to put more work on the back and cloak, but for tomorrow's event, we're there. This looks pretty sick.

I still need to do the base, but I'll let everything dry and matte it down first.

Man, I really want to paint a whole Kador army now. Why am I like this?
