## Transcript

Oh god. Okay, it's Butcher time, baby. We're going to start by getting my painting handle. Oh, it's right here. Don't worry. False alarm. Okay, painting handle check.

All right. And I also magnetized the bottom of his base, too. So now I have a very scientific setup to stay in frame. I drew a box around on this piece of paper so I could know when I'm staying in frame. Try to keep the palette right here so you can maybe see what's going on. But I really—I've decided I'm going to dig into these Army Painter Speed Paints because I've realized that if I'm not going all out, I really want to kind of perfect a speed painting thing.

And also I cleaned the Butcher up, but I just saw these mold lines on his hand. And that's very unfortunate because I just don't have time. So, we're gonna have to paint over them and we'll have to come back to them and sand those off. Oh, it's up to the cane. Oh, Matt. Oh my god. Did I even clean this guy off? I swear I thought I cleaned him off. But those lines are going to bother me. But the show must go on.

Red's done. Man, this Foot Angel's Contrast Red is just so magic. I don't like how the shoulder pads look just from the tea staining kind of—contrast over those big flat surfaces sucks. I'm going to touch all the red up with Mephiston Red. I don't know why I went to say it with the accent, but all the reds are base coated. Gonna get everything base coated before I come back and actually finish colors.

Also, I realized that there was just a whole chunk of sprue for some reason. I thought that was like part of the bag. So, I had to file that off and then I primed it. Going to hopefully work some magic with the brown there, but it's probably going to look like ass on that spot. But, it is what it is. Maybe I'll do his satchel in Satchel Brown and see how that looks—act dark to cover up where I had to reprime it.

All right. I just did base coat brown. Satchel Brown on the sack. Just gloves. Oh, missed a spot.

Okay. I did the brown parts that I missed again. Just base coating. I'm going to come back in with real paint to paint the highlights. Next, I'm going to hit all these skulls with Bony Matter. And I'm going to hit the ropes, too. And I'm going to try to be lazy and see if I can get away with just doing that. I'll hit the ropes with a different color just to differentiate it. But it's pretty nuts how good Bony Matter actually is. And there's a sack of skulls right here. Let's see what happens right here.

All right, we're going to use Carmine Dragon on these berries and the bows. I have no idea what this is going to look like. We're going to find out together.

All right, this is pretty bright. We'll see. This might be what I'm looking for. Hopefully.

All right, did all the berries. Look sick. Instead of doing the green, because I don't know which green I want to do yet, I'm just going to keep the momentum—hop like gold. I just don't have it in me to do non-metallic metal to try and get him done. I'm coming down to the wire.

Gold's in again. We're not going to win any awards with it, but it looks good. We're just trying to get a cool looking tabletop model. All right. He's looking pretty cool. So, now bronze—going to hit the nuts. This thing on the back.

Getting close to the scary stuff. Boom. Here we go. This is where we're going to have to stop for right now. I need to do the socks, the stocking, the ropes, all the white stuff. I want to figure out the face and the glasses. This extra second leather cover, the cape, and then I'll go back in. Oh, I got to—I missed a nut.

Okay, I just did the beard real fast with Battleship Gray. Really love how this looks. And I'll go back and probably come in with some more white on top, but if I don't, it looks great.

Look, Forest Green. That seems right. That seems like the vibes I'm going for. Man, these Army Painter colors really are awesome. And I saw—I think this is a candy cane. And I just painted it green without realizing.

You know, I don't know what these pine cone looking things are in the back. I don't know what these things are. They look like pine cone grenades to me. So, I just painted them with Brownish Decay, which is my favorite paint color. And that's also what I'm going to hit this cornucopia with just because I love it and I don't really know what color these should be.

Okay, so I just Brownish Decayed all of the remaining leather parts. Carefully.

All right. Oh, yeah. And I hit the stitches on the arm with it. Didn't do the cloak yet.

I think it's time—I got to stop running away from painting. Oh, I got to do the stocking. Let's do the stocking. Oh, and a belt buckle. We missed the belt buckle.

Okay, we're going to try Slaughter Red on this cloak. I wanted something different from the armor, but I don't know if this is going to be different enough, but hopefully it is. I'm looking at pictures of it online and it looks pretty sick.

And I think I'm missing some paint somehow. So, we're going to have to see. How does this compare to these other guys? Oh, that looks good, actually. That looks like kind of blood. Yeah, I think this will be good. Probably use my bigger brush here just because I really want to load this up.

Oh, yeah. That's good. I think I need more.

Oh god. No. At least I got it on camera. At least I got—yeah, I'll leave it alone. And if I need to fix anything, I'll go back over top of it. Because I think it's already starting to dry on me and I just don't want to—don't want to do that.

All right, I'll leave it alone. I'll hit it again if I have to. It's probably because I'm probably going to have to. But I do like that color though. But jeez.

Oh man. All right, guys. So, we just kind of painted the rest of the owl here. I went back in with Mephiston Red overall. And you can still see it kind of drying. I just glazed it in to fix kind of the water marks and just added a little bit more of that red in. I went back over all of the parts that were white and I hit them. I got my tiny brush out and I just actually came back in to reestablish that white.

On the skulls I glazed in Kislev Flesh and you can see it right here in the palette. Just probably like 50/50 and just to add just a little bit more polish to the skulls. Got to do it to the skulls.

The glasses—hopefully you can see this face. I used Tidal Wave. I glazed several layers of Tidal Wave over it and then I mixed in the Tidal Wave with the white to get there and then on the actual reflection it's pure white and then his skin of course is Kislev Flesh with a little red on the nose. Hopefully it's coming through.

But for a one day painting, I love how this turned out. Obviously, I would like to put more work on the back, more work on the cloak, but I think for tomorrow, we're there. This looks pretty sick. I'm pretty happy. I'm really happy with it. It makes me want to strip the rest of that Khador and paint it up. But it's just too late. Not going to get time to do it. I'm going to touch up some broken stuff, but I think this is what it's going to be.

I got to do his base still. But I'm going to let everything dry and then matte him down. Oh man, I got to think about that. I got to let him matte down and then think about the base. So that might—I don't know. I'll deal with that later.

But thanks for watching. Tomorrow I'll show off more of the army because I'm just going to matte spray the whole army down. But man, I really want to paint a whole Khador army now. Why am I like this?
