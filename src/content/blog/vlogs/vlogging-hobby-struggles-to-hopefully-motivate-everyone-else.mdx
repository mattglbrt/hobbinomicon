## Waiting for Paint to Dry

Waiting for these test goblins to dry. Working on what I'm playing in the Warmachine event this weekend. This is the only guy I'll have to paint—got everything else done.

## The Great Mystery

Got this off Facebook Marketplace. They took the time to pin this tiny little arm—super glue and green stuff would have been enough—but they didn't trim the mold lines.

Who takes the time to pin a tiny baby arm but not trim the mold lines? Am I the crazy one?

## Time Confusion

I thought today was Thursday, so I didn't have anywhere near as much time to paint as I thought.

I like where the robes are at. Definitely locked in our robe method. Trying out different greens on the test guys in the back. Found a bunch of greens I don't like at all.

I think I got the teeth and hands. Still not quite what I want.

## Finding Inspiration

Flicking through Instagram looking for a better way to do these night goblins. Found tons of great stuff, but nothing clicked until I came across Quantic Color Studio.

Some of the coolest looking old school night goblins I've seen. I love what he did with the eyes and lips—that blue on the lips, purple on the eyes. His shadows have the purple we already have, just reinforced more.

## The Plan

I'm just going to shamelessly steal his scheme. Going to regroup.

You can probably hear I'm stuffed up. Fighting some kind of virus for the last couple days. Tomorrow when I can paint during the day, I'll try my best to copy this scheme.

The green's too dark on my tests or something. Playing around with some NMM gold for bracelets and spear tips. Definitely going to airbrush again.

Several days of struggling, but I'm finally feeling good about these. Tomorrow I'll hopefully make major progress on all these goblins.
