## Transcript

Okay, so I'm waiting for these test goblins in the back to dry a little bit. And I'm working on what I'm going to play in the Warmachine event this weekend. This is the only guy I'm going to have to paint. I got everything else painted but this guy.

I got this off Facebook Marketplace, right? And I just don't understand. They took the time to pin this little tiny arm, which like super glue and green stuff would have been enough, but they didn't trim the mold lines. So, like, who takes the time to pin a tiny little baby arm but not trim the mold lines, you know? Is that me? Am I the weird one? Am I the crazy one?

For some reason, I was thinking today was Thursday, so I actually didn't have anywhere near as much time to paint as I thought I was going to. But I like where the robes are at. I think we definitely locked in our robe method.

On this guy, I was trying to see where we were at trying out a few different greens on the guys in the back. I have found a bunch of greens that I don't like at all. And I think I found something that I do want to try tomorrow. I like the teeth. Like I think I got the teeth and the hands. This guy's not too bad. It's still not quite what I want.

So which brings me to this. I was flicking through Instagram and I was trying to get some inspiration on a better way of doing these night goblins and there was a ton of great stuff, but I wasn't really finding anything until I came across this.

Quantic Color Studio has some of the coolest looking old school night goblins I think I've seen. So, I'm going to just shamelessly steal his scheme. I love what he's done with the eyes and the lips here. That blue on the lips and the purple on the eye. And I'm zooming in. You can see in his shadows he has that purple that we already have. He definitely has reinforced it more. So I think we're going to go back and do that ourselves. I just think it looks awesome.

So going to regroup. You can probably hear I'm pretty stuffed up in my voice. I've been like fighting some kind of a virus or something for the last couple of days and I'm just really feeling it.

So tomorrow when I can paint during the day, gonna regroup and try our best to copy this scheme. You know, from like tabletop distance, that one doesn't look too good, but the one that I took up to like tabletop level, he actually looks pretty good from far away. But again, it's just not what I'm after. I don't—I think the green's too dark or something.

I'm playing around with some non-metallic metallic gold is probably what I'll do for like the bracelets and stuff and the spear tips. I am definitely going to airbrush again.

So, I don't know. I think I got to call it, but I think I'm finally feeling good about these after several days of struggling. So, I'll see you tomorrow where I will hopefully finally make major progress on all these goblins.
