## No-Nonsense Guide

Today I have a no-nonsense guide on painting grim dark pale orc flesh.

## The Spit Effect Secret

If you want cool spit effects, it's just UHU glue on the model. Dab it on with a toothpick. It's that easy.

## The Recipe

### Step 1: Base Coat
Pallid Wych Flesh all over the model.

### Step 2: Pink Areas
Mix Quick Shade Wash Medium with Bugman's Glow 50/50. Put this on the mouth, hands, and elbows—anywhere that's going to be pinker flesh.

### Step 3: Streaking Grime
Cover the whole model with streaking grime.

### Step 4: Wipe Away
Wipe it away with a sponge and Q-tip. This is what turns the skin green.

### Step 5: Mineral Spirits
Come back in with mineral spirits on the very tops of muscles, teeth, and nails.

### Step 6: Highlights
Use Menoth White from P3 to paint the nails, teeth, and highlight the very tops of muscles—especially on the shoulders.

### Step 7: Optional Crimson
In some places, go back with a small wash of Carroburg Crimson on those areas where you put Bugman's Glow.

### Step 8: Eyes
Just put a white dot for beady little eyes.

## Very Fast, Very Effective

And there you go. Very fast, very effective.
