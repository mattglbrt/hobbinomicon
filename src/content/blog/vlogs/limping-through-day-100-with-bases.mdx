## Day 100—And I'm the Sickest Yet

Currently the most sick of this sickness. But I just finished printing the last plate for Crucible Guard. I just based all of the Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent.

I realized I'm going to have to print bases for Crucible Guard because I just don't have enough normal bases left. I want to use them for other stuff.

## The Z-Index Trick

Going to pop these in Lychee Slicer. I'm using the center button and the move tool, then making sure the bases are on the platform so I know they're even.

Most of the time the magic number was to adjust the Z-index to 2.58 for all the 50mm bases. This was the lowest I could get it without the base below showing through.

What you can do is just pick the base insert and tweak it by 0.1mm at a time. When the actual base part is going to pop through and ruin your detail, you'll see the gray space mixed in with the blue. So that's how you can tweak it.

## The Problem with Normal Base Inserts

I'm doing this because the base inserts are either too thick or the bases themselves are too shallow. I think it looks terrible trying to use the base inserts normally. Hopefully this Z-index trick will let me print them.

I'm going to put them at a 45-degree angle and then support them. To support bases, you just put a ton at the first bottom lip and then a couple up around the edge and on the top.

## What I Wanted for Day 100

I had really cool ideas of what I wanted to do for 100 videos straight, and that's just going to have to be postponed. But I am struggling right now.

I've been curled up on the couch playing a lot of Dragon Warrior Monsters—I've recently rediscovered that and been going hard on it. I've been reading through the Dolmenwood player's handbook just to get a really good understanding of how it works.

And I'm really going to try to get an oil wash on that board tonight. Wish me luck!
