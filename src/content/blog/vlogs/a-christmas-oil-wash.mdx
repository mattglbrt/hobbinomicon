## Christmas Hobby Time

Quick one on Christmas. Finally getting this oil wash done. Mineral spirits are in here.

My cup's too big to fit the brush in, so I got to be a little bit strategic. I don't want to slap this everywhere because it'll be very easy to make a mess with this. So we're just going to be careful.

## Working the Wash

Just working this out and around. And just like that, we're going to be back into our actual earth and dirt tones.

I'm checking for any excessive pooling. Going to let this dry just a little bit.

## Almost There

I've pulled the excess off and it's still pretty wet. I think it's going to be a little bit before I can actually show you the finished result.

But this is where we're at today on Christmas—sneaking the hobby in while everybody is napping and winding down.

Merry Christmas to you guys. Hopefully my voice comes back soon. It's been a brutal week, but thanks for being here. Merry Christmas again!
