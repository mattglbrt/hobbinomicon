## Rolling for the Next Monster

Time to find out our next monster for the Dolmenwood Pokédex project. I rolled a 12, which brings us to the Brago Shawhorn again. Last time I did 23 and just did page count. This time, both methods point to the same monster—I guess we're really meant to paint the Brago Shawhorn. We're not going to tempt fate.

## Mini Crate Unboxing

The Dusk mini crate arrived! What's really cool is they sent me two arms—they knew it would probably break at that spot. It's two parts so it won't snap off, which most certainly would have happened otherwise. They're learning, getting better on their packaging. Much appreciated.

I love that sculpt way more than the normal Warcaster. In fact, a big part of why I didn't want to play Dusk was how much I didn't like her sculpt. This changes things.

## A Variety Hour

Today is going to be a variety hobby day. I want to finish basing this model because I don't want a bunch of models that are almost done but not based. I grabbed the first brown I saw—just going to get some brown on here and then flock it.

I haven't used flock in so long. It'll be nice to switch back to it. Just straight out of the pot, didn't water it down, didn't do two thin coats. We're going to cover this whole base in material anyway.

## The Danger of Planning

One thing to remember about all this goal-setting we did yesterday: your brain gets a dopamine boost from writing it all down and planning it, but it's not the same thing as actually doing it.

When you do this and get that feeling like "wow, I'm actually doing something"—you're not actually doing something. In a way, all of this is really just procrastination.

It's not the same as actually selling it. Not the same as actually painting it. Not the same as actually playing it.

When you do stuff like this, definitely set a timer, set a time limit. Don't spend all day going over it and mistaking this for actually participating. The reward you get from actually painting it, actually doing it, will be so much more than this little hit you get right now.

It's really tricky to balance and really addictive—you could sit and just plan all day. It's nowhere near as rewarding as actually doing it, and it's really easy to fall into that trap.

## Old School Flocking

This turf has got to be at least 20 years old. I can't believe it's still sealed. I had a bunch of these smaller packs.

Just spread this watered down glue on the base—it also has isopropyl alcohol in it. As long as you're doing it over something where you can put it back in the bag, just put way more on than you need so you know it's going to stick.

I haven't used flock in so long. It's so nostalgic because I've just been using basing paste, rocks, baking soda, and then painting it green if I wanted to. This stuff is usually just sawdust and sponge foam mixed together.

## Progress on Other Projects

I'm in the middle of building the Going Merry LEGO set. I got it as a gift without knowing about One Piece, and then I was putting off the show for years. Then Ice King talked me into playing the One Piece card game, so it's all One Piece all the time now.

The bulk of painting today is going to be on the Crucible Guard assembly line. I want to get those done this week so I can move on to the Triumvirate and the Infinity project.

I've been slowly trucking through the Infinity guy—started off base coating on the shield, doing some blends. Got most of the armor done now. That white over purplish is going to be pretty sick. Started cutting in black. Struggling through that one.

See you tomorrow when we come back in with a lighter color to finish her up.
