## A Realization Hitting Like a Ton of Bricks

Quick one tonight. I have a question that's going to help me with my video for tomorrow: **Do you play any co-op or solo games?**

I'm looking to get into that world because I've realized something—the only hope I have of gaming is solo or co-op stuff I can do at home. I realized a couple days ago that competitive wargaming is over for me, but I'm not ready to give up on this thing I love.

## My Solo Game Collection

Looking at my shelf, I actually have more solo content than I thought:

- **Kingdom Death** - Bought it for the miniatures, but now I'm thinking maybe I should give the actual game a shot
- **Dragon Bane** - Has a solo mode
- **Moria** for The One Ring with Strider Mode
- **Forbidden Psalm** and all the Mork Borg stuff
- **Hobgoblin** - Also has a solo mode, plus I have the cards
- **Rangers of Shadow Deep** - The very nice edition, though I can't find it right now (two books are just missing)
- **Gathering of Heroes** - Somewhere...

## The Path Forward

I want to do Dolmenwood solo. I had planned on just kind of playing around with that and eventually still doing full Dolmenwood parties, but I've also realized that for D&D, solo is the path forward for me—at least for a couple years with my current situation.

So now I'm thinking: let me embrace this solo world.

## Looking for Recommendations

For my 30 regular viewers—are you doing solo stuff? Co-op stuff? I need good solo and co-op suggestions.

There's a lot of books on my shelf that I got just to support indie authors doing their thing and to read over them. Now I'm thinking I should probably start checking these out and actually play them.

Tomorrow I'm planning a video that goes more into the solo gaming world. Let me know your recommendations.
