## Transcript

So we finally did it. I finally painted a goblin that I'm happy with. Now let me show you a couple things that I did to him. But first, here's Quantic Color Studio's image. I know you can't see his face that well, so let's look at mine. So, I did the blue on the lips and I have to say, I freaking love it. I think it looks so rad. And then the purple eyes—as you can see, these eyes are not anywhere near as good as his. The good news is these are going to be at a tabletop distance, so they should look fine.

But the skin here, we got that purple shading from the pre-shade and then coming up and getting the highlight with Scale Color Alizarin Green, which was actually in my collection and I didn't realize it. It was really nice. So, we got our Alizarin Green plus Lime Green highlights, and I got to say, I think this looks great.

And just so you can see, let's look at these other guys. So, these are going to be my before and after. And here is the one I repainted. And I gotta be honest, I can't tell much of a difference between this green and this green, but I like this green better. The blue lips are killer. So we're just going to speed run through and add the blue lips to everybody. It doesn't take very long. And then we'll add the highlights. And honestly, I think we're good to start basing. And once basing's done, I think they're ready to go.

So, I did his little gem—or I don't think it's a gem. I'm not really sure what it is. I did his little yellow spot with yellow. And let's just see where we're at from tabletop. I think he looks great. Even the purple robe came out nice. We got our splotchy highlight I was going for.

And then let's look at the other two. So, I got 30 goblin robes done. I only need to update the skin on 12 of these guys. The other 18 that are the squig riders, we don't see any of their skin. They're fully covered. And that's just going to be a couple of blasts with the airbrush, and then we're good to go. So, we are well on our way to finishing this goblin project.

But, let me show you the secret project. And then I'll catch you up to where I started at on the update. So, I kind of alluded to it. I was teasing it. But I've been building a Vampire Counts halfling army. I built two kits of these skeleton guys. We got two units of zombies, and then this is my vampire lord on her throne. Kind of over here in the back.

And this has been a lot of fun. I used for these guys on the thrones the Frostgrave Wizard set. So, the actual halflings are 3D printed, and then these guys are their familiars. And I just think it's so much fun and goofy. And these are going to look rad.

So, I need to get the one other hero built. I actually need to go and magnetize all of these because they're not magnetized yet. They're just kind of sitting there. And I need to build—I think I'm going to build a corpse cart. I have this swamp thing that I think I'm going to try to use for a corpse cart. And then I'm going to get these primed and ready, and these will be my next project.

So, the update on where we're at, I'm just kind of messing around with these guys. I gotta cast my hero for this halfling army, but I can't cast him because I don't have a vacuum chamber running. So, I have to build that, and I just keep putting it off.

So, this is going to be my casting area. It's going to have a pressure pot here and a vacuum pot here. And I'm going to have them tied together through this manifold, which I've already built. And that manifold was going to connect to a compressor, but the compressor is going to be too loud. So, I'm now running it to a vacuum pump. And that vacuum pump is going to run this guy.

So, as you can see, I have the pump hooked up. And we're going to put this hose through the top here, and I'm going to have a quick connect that I use to pull vacuum. And this hose was way too long, so I had to cut it. I got too much, and now I don't have enough because I overcut. So, I got a new one coming in tomorrow.

But once that is done, I can start pulling vacuum and degassing resin. And then I'll have the casting station finished, which I really need to do because I got approved for a wholesale account with a resin company for the molds. But in order to take advantage of it, I have to spend a certain amount of money and I have to actually cast things. So, we're getting there.

Okay, so I'm kind of wrapped. Feeling good that we got the scheme for the goblins. It was kind of touch and go for a minute because I was really, really frustrated. But the key breakthrough was realizing I already had Alizarin Green and just didn't know it. And once we started using that and our Lime Green with the Speed Paint, it looked a lot better. So, going to regroup tomorrow and hopefully start finishing these guys so we can finish before the end of Orctober. Thanks!
