## Very Happy With This Little Guy

He looks good! When you see him at tabletop level, he looks awesome. Hopefully we'll have 90 more by this time tomorrow.

## Finally Found the Right Green

After doing 12 different goblins and different shades of green, I found one I actually like. Over our airbrush workup: Alizarin Green, then Lime Green (doing a lot of the work on top).

Based on that scheme we saw on Instagram, but his was more desaturated—that pale green. I kind of like this vibrant skin tone though. It's crazy in real life.

## The Details

- Totally stole his blue lips—love the lips
- Going to add more violet to reestablish the shadows
- Purple eyes (just dotted in for now)
- Spear still needs love, but everything else is mostly done

## The Secret Second Army

As insane as this sounds, I've been working on a whole second army this whole time. Some days I couldn't paint but could build during meetings.

Built a whole Vampire Counts army—50 zombies/skeletons. They're halflings! Old World Vampire Counts but undead halflings, which is awesome.

The vampire lord/battle standard bearer has a halfling coming up out of the ground behind him—like he's summoning his banner holder wherever he goes.

## Progress Report

About 30 goblins have robes done, need to update skin on 12. Made a lot of progress today. Finally over this crazy block.

Tomorrow I'm done with work at noon, kids are with a babysitter. Time to power through!

## What's Coming

- Still have all the orcs (20 orcs, night goblin heroes, orc on wyvern)
- Vacuum chamber for casting is ready (need silicone and resin)
- Got the wholesale account—frogs coming soon
- Rest of the year: just painting because everything is built
