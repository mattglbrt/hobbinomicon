## Full Successful Print

Got a full successful print for my quartz. While that was going, I had a crazy idea for my website—wanted to create some kind of Easter egg. Thought of the toad, the chaos toad from Miscast as inspiration.

## Pixel Art Vibing

Opened up Aseprite and just started vibing out. I learned this program years ago to make Perler bead sprites—probably in high school. My only advice is to just keep doing it over and over again and you get better at it. I start with the outline first, then color in the inside. Once you have the outline, it's a lot easier.

## Crown and Skull Character Building

Now for the real content—building characters in Crown and Skull. I built a custom tool that runs locally with all the options for custom spell building and equipment that aren't in the free kit.

You pick a character, start with 50 points, and build things out. I wanted to create a custom spell—a blizzard effect based on a mix of abilities—and a custom greatsword. The thing I love about Crown and Skull is you can really adapt anything you want into it.

## Building Out the Party

For the main character, I started her at 150 points so I could make the two cats as companions instead of their own characters. In Crown and Skull, your skills and equipment are actually your HP, which I think is pretty cool.

The other characters are normal 50 point builds. One guy is my repair and support character—an armorer with medical knowledge. Another is my climber and outdoorsman with a helm and climbing gear. Then there's my glass cannon dual-wielder who can only take about five real hits before she's out of commission.

## The Solo Campaign Vision

My plan for this solo campaign is to have fun and play it out, but these characters will become legendary NPCs for when I run campaigns with a full group later.

## Airbrush Maintenance

Got one of those cleanout pots I've always wanted—finally upgraded from using jars with paper towels over the top. Did some maintenance on the airbrush, gave it a good clean, and lubed it up.

The airbrush still isn't 100%—there's something in the internals—but it's working well enough to finish priming. That's all we needed.

## Tomorrow is Day One

Tomorrow is day one of the new painting journey to get as good as possible. I've got a lot of thoughts on that because it's a big turning point—starting the next chapter of my life for me. As ridiculous as that sounds, it's a lot deeper than just deciding I want to paint.
