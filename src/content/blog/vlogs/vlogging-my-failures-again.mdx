## New Day, New Shirt

Took a shower. Need to shave my head again. The main room behind me is crazy—those bookshelves are my deepest shame.

## The Goblin Base Test

These are dry now. Let's test them.

Our greatest fears have been confirmed. We're just too late. Going to have to pop them all off, seal them down, and reglue them.

## The Fix

Upon reflection, I'm just going to bust all these goblins off, scrape the base material down to the base, plastic glue them to the actual base, and stop being silly trying to take shortcuts.

If I would have done that yesterday, it would have taken 15-20 minutes. Lesson learned.

## More Casting Woes

The demon prince mold—he came off the bottom and floated to the top. Don't know what we're going to get, but probably not a good cast.

Technically not wasted. I'll let it cure, cut it up, and use the chunks in future molds. Need to buy more silicone before making more molds anyway.

## Making My Own Music

Since everything else has been a bust, I'm showing you something else I've been working on.

My very second video got a copyright strike for using royalty-free music from a bot or spammer. I refuted and won, but now I'm making my own music.

Using an app on my iPad called Koala, which samples pretty much anything. I've only used two things:
1. A whistle—I whistled a little diddy
2. Smacking on the belly gut

Plus some E-ring dungeon synth. It's definitely not complete, still rough, but I'm slowly figuring it out and teaching myself so I can make my own music for videos.

## Tomorrow

Tomorrow we will finally get to painting.
