## Transcript

Okay, time to finish these guys. Actually, I just primed this, so it's probably not happening today. So, we're going to work on this. So, this is 3D printed. There shouldn't be too much like cleanup and definitely no mold lines. But I'm just going to look everything over looking for supports or maybe just any errors that occurred in the print. Like you can kind of see these little nubbies on the bottom, but that doesn't really matter because you're not going to see that when the print happens.

So, I'm just going to go through. I'm going to put a mask on just because with the resin—to fix any of these imperfections right here, I'm going to sand it and I just don't want to breathe that in. With 3D printed resin, you got to use super glue.

So, if you watched my unboxing video, this is the wing that was broken and it looks a little gnarly on that connection right there, but I've actually sanded it pretty flush. And—oh god, exactly one foot. Like on this side, you can see I got it pretty solid. I bent it—I got it hot with a heat gun and then I bent it so it kind of follows the curve of how the wing is supposed to be. I need to hit it again just to straighten everything out a little bit, I think. But it's doing pretty good. I got the torso all cleaned up and glued.

I'm going to fix the remaining parts to the wing. That last missing piece was like this little nub on the hilt of the sword. Wait, not hilt—the handle. The handle on the sword right here. Also, the sword was pretty crooked, so I got both swords mostly straight. I think I need to tweak it a little bit now that I'm looking at it on camera.

So I only had—let's see, I had exactly 22 minutes of hobby time in today. And it doesn't seem like a lot, but I got all of these primed. And I got most of the annoying parts of this build done. Like there's a couple of supports left on the arms that are up in there that I got to get and I'll get those before I go to bed. But I got all the supports off.

I straightened everything out that needed the heat gun to get straight and I glued all the parts back in and just filed them together to make them look like one piece—all before bed. So I'm going to call that a success on a day where again—that's the one thing I've learned over these last two weeks of just being miserable.

These last two weeks have been very rough, but I just had like sometimes 10 minutes, 20 minutes. I think tonight at that 22 minute mark is probably the most time I've had to hobby in two weeks. But when I look back at all the stuff I've got done—I did all those goblin spears. At this point, I've got like half of the skin done. I've done the Phantasm tonight, which all tomorrow I just got to do some magnets, which I like the magnet part, and gluing up the last bit together, and that guy will be ready to go.

Tomorrow, I'll actually be able to finish my blocks for the Mòlley Crew board. And also I think tomorrow hopefully things kind of settle down and return to normal where I can get some real hobby time in and start sleeping again—that would be pretty cool.

So I don't know, that's just really what I've learned—is just how much I can still accomplish if it's only sometimes like five or 10 minutes a day. Really showed me these last two weeks that like there really isn't an excuse to do the things you love. Like even if you got 10 minutes a day to kind of refill that bucket. If I wasn't down here making videos, it would have just been even worse really.

So it seems like so much to do and overcome when you're in the thick of things, but then afterwards—like I feel much better now. I'm going to go to bed in a good mood, happy, wake up hopefully refreshed just to get beat down again tomorrow. But I don't know. It's going to get better soonish and it's just cool doing this.
