## Transcript

What's up, guys? Vlog day seven, and we're finally gonna finish this thing. And there's barely any paint. I've actually already hit this once. It's really coming together, guys.

All right, guys. It's time. We're going to cut all this excess foam off so we get just our board, right? And this stuff that's going to be like growing out of corners and cracks. Put this big boy in the middle. Since these two blocks are the same, they're like the same color and the same height. I'm going to put it here. Even though these are actually like right next to each other, by putting this here, it's going to make your mind think that this is like sloped down into the water—could go there. So, we come in and while that is drying, I'm going to like pinch this here.

And I want these long because I'm going to tuck them like tuck them down in between. So cut. Oh god. You don't cut it like that. Even up. You want all the ends on this one to be even. And then you kind of roll it around. Okay. And now same thing. This is this grass—like long static grass. And it's the same concept. So what you can do with this since this is already cut. I'm not cutting it off something. I'm gonna pinch it in the middle, put the glue right here, and then I have two tufts already. So, I don't want to overdo it, right? I think I only—I don't—I think I'll probably only do like two more of these actually. So, I made a couple extra ones that are the pale color—stuff that maybe like water used to collect there and it grew, but obviously it's not collecting there anymore.

All right, I think it's time. I shook the hell out of this moss. I'm hitting it with a heat gun right now. Hitting the board with the heat gun.

All right. So, we're just going to go section by section here. And I don't really know what I'm doing. I just watched Trent's video. I'll link that in the description where he was way more scientific about it. But I'm not. I'm just going to—oh, look. Like the heat gun is actually making it bubble. Yeah. So like I've got the heat gun going on it right as I'm like putting this in there. Hell yeah. I guess I should have probably thought about the tufts. I didn't really think that these would get affected by the heat gun that much. This is crazy. Look at that, baby. Thank you, Trent.

All right, I'm done with the moss. I was starting to feel myself go a little bit crazy with it. So I backed off because it was about to get out of hand.

All right, guys. Disaster has struck. I was trying to go back and fix some of these stones that I overworked. And I think the board looks great now. Like it's mostly perfect, but on this one, I accidentally hit the switch to like take the heat gun from like a normal heat gun to like third-degree burn heat gun and it melted like this. These four squares—like this one's melted.

I have an idea on how to fix that, but like this one is just straight—so, I have that AK Interactive paste. And what I am going to do, which is very hard to do with the camera where I have it. Oh jeez, this one's really bad over here. You guys weren't going to tell me about that one. I almost put all my stuff away. And then some of these spots, I'm putting this on thick. Like right here, I just totally gap filled that. Look at this. Look at this. I don't like anything that doesn't look organic. This is what got me into this mess. I came back in.

This is just water, by the way. So, this is what I did—I reactivated everything by hitting it with water again and just kind of like blending it in. And I didn't even use any more. I really like that effect. Like I want to hit the whole board with that. I'll do something else and I'll hit like the whole board with it to try to get this effect because that's perfect. And it sucks. Then I'll have to cover some of it up. But even—I think I got pretty lucky that more of this board didn't warp. And I need to just stop.

But now I'm excited and here's why. I went to my bits box and I got these. So, I just took this bit that we chopped off. Super glue. A little dollop of super glue. Those two bits are going to add so much character into the board right there. I just want to add like another kind of tiny point of interest like over in this section and over in that section. So, as always, skulls where it's light. I can just come back in with Dirty Down—the moss—and just hit it. And even—I'm obviously not going to use that heat gun anymore.

This is turning into a mossy—my intent was not for it to be this mossy. Oh god, everything's turning into moss. God, it's everywhere. I can't stop it. It's in me now. It's part of me. I'm not even in control. I'm just doing what the moss is telling me to do.
