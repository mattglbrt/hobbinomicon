## Day Seven - Finally Finishing

Really coming together now. Cut all the excess foam off, add the centerpiece blocks.

## Placement Psychology

Since two blocks are the same color and height, I put them apart. Putting them here makes your mind think there's a slope down where water could collect.

## Static Grass Technique

For long static grass: pinch in the middle, put glue there, and you have two tufts already. Don't overdo it—just two more.

Made extra pale-colored ones where water used to collect but doesn't anymore.

## The Heat Gun Magic

Shook the hell out of the moss. Hitting the board with a heat gun while applying it—the moss actually bubbles up! Thank you Trent (linked his more scientific video).

The tufts got affected by the heat gun more than expected. Watch Trent's video for the proper method.

## The Moss Takes Over

I backed off because I was starting to go crazy with it. It was about to get out of hand...

"It's everywhere. I can't stop it. It's in me now. It's part of me. I'm not even in control. I'm just doing what the moss is telling me to do."

## Disaster Strikes

Was trying to fix some overworked stones. Accidentally hit the switch to take the heat gun from normal to "third-degree burn" mode. Melted four squares.

## The Fix

Using AK interactive paste to gap fill the melted areas. For the reactivation effect, I just hit it with water again—blending everything in without using more product. That effect is perfect.

## Character Pieces

Went to the bits box—added skull bits for extra character. Just two little points of interest add so much.
