## Morning Success

Good morning! We have a successful print that looks really cool in clear resin. I'm going to have to do more stuff with clear resin.

Got the wings and I'm returning the Ice King's airbrush. We're on the way to meet him, got him strapped into the minivan.

## The New Airbrush

The day is here. We made it. We have our next permanent airbrush. It's a Creos 771—pretty much on par with the higher-end Iwatas. Definitely the nicest airbrush I've ever used.

It feels amazing in hand. The trigger on this is the best trigger I've ever felt. This is a huge improvement over the Iwata I had.

## The Priming Session

I'm not going to prime on sticks or anything—I'm going to prime each individual model. Time-wise that's not the most efficient, but it's going to give me a ton of practice with this airbrush and really let me get used to that trigger action.

I've got the air control valve on the front wide open, trigger stop on the back all the way open because I want to learn what it can do.

### The Results

After an hour and a half, I am extremely happy with it. What you're seeing is actually half of what I primed—I have a secret project that's a whole other thing.

It clogged once on me at about 90 models. Took me exactly 3 minutes to unclog it. I was able to pop the outer nozzle off, see the clog, and get it out. That in itself is pretty amazing. Right back in priming with no issues at all.

## The Schedule

It's 11:45 PM, so I have 16 minutes to get the video finished and uploaded. I also got the rest of Mollog's Crew printed and primed with a couple extra guys. (I'd printed these before but dropped them down the stairs and they shattered because they're 3D printed—my fault.)

Today is the 19th, Sunday. We've got 10 days to get the whole army done because the airbrush issues hit a pretty big snag.

### The Plan

Tomorrow I'm going to try to do all the airbrush work. Start with the goblins, get all the airbrush work done so it's all just brush work left for them. This week I can have all that stuff done and painted, then have time for basing and detailed work.

Sunday the 26th I'm playing at a Warmachine event, so I want most of the army done by then. And I should probably have something painted for that event too.

This is going to be a week full of painting now that we've got the airbrush and we're fully firing on all cylinders again. Thanks for watching—tomorrow we're finally going to be doing crazy painting non-stop all day.
