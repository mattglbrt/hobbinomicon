## Transcript

Hey, see the very first print with the clear resin came out great. Like look at how sick that is. See how translucent it is? That's going to be awesome once it's painted.

Today we're going to drop Ice King's airbrush back off with him and then he's going to print me some wings. And then the real goal today is to get all the goblins and orcs primed. I think we're going to be able to do it. I think I have to do it. So, if we do, we're going to be doing pretty good. But today is definitely going to be a big hobby day. First, I need to grab all the junk from the car and drop it off with Ice King.

All right, we made it to Ice King's house. We got this box right here, which is his airbrush. So let me drop that off with him.

New airbrush, kind of a bootleg unboxing here. I got this Creos 771. This is one that Ice King recommended. His whole deal is like figuring out these super high quality airbrushes from like factories in Japan and China that are like just as good as the Iwatas and things like that. This is comparable to like a mid to high range Iwata and significantly cheaper than that, but just as good, if not better. So we're going to crack it open. There is an airbrush here. This is the body. Looks clean. Like, looks like a high-end airbrush. So let me go ahead and see if I can zoom in on some of this. It does have like the MAC valve there. So you can get like a cushioned action from the trigger, which is cool. Screw on here for that gravity feed cup. There it is. And that's what it looks like with the cup on.\

All right. So we got all these goblins on a board that we're going to go ahead and prime. I'm going to go ahead and start off with my black primer. And I'm going to go over these pretty fast just because there's a lot of it. Like a lot, a lot.

I don't know how much footage I'm actually going to be able to show you just because like I got to prime and I want to prime more than I want to make content right now. But I can definitely hop back in and show you the progress. This is insane. That doesn't even show half of it.

Okay. So I went through all of those on a black primer without a single clog. Let's see if I can knock this one out. So I just primed all the goblins black. Now I'm going to go and just hit them from an angle here, maybe a little bit above. And this is going to represent just a desatured version of their skin before we actually move on to paint the models. So I'm going to go through all the models for a second time and then all the models again a third time. So I'm not even a third of the way done but, we're cooking.

So this is the third color that I'm hitting everything with. This is a white ink, Liquitex white ink. I'm going to point the airbrush down pretty much straight at the models. Get a true like zenithal prime going, especially for like all the top facing areas. But this is kind of the final step on priming before I go back in and add like the green base coat or whatever colors I add on top.

All right. We have one prime clog, which is impressive. I'm using this compressor, the tiny portable guy. And it does not have a moisture trap in it, which means it's slowly depositing moisture into my airbrush. And I've gone through like a lot of paint and not cleaned it out once. So I'm actually surprised I got this far without it clogging. But this will be like three minutes and I'll knock it out and I'll be back to priming.

I'm starting to reprint the Motley Crews models. So I got these fellas up from the resin. And I feel good because I basically just like one-to-one double-checked their settings. And I also leveled out my build plate again. Dropped the originals down the stairs, so, here we are.

What it looks like now. So I got all the rank and file goblins primed. I've got the mangler squigs not quite primed. I got the wolf riders there, various orcs and night goblins, about 90 models total. I'm going to try to run through there and do an actual zenithal, so pointing almost straight down instead of at an angle. And I'm going to try to get some of the pre-shading done, too. But that will start tomorrow's video.

But what a massive milestone. Day 19, and we've got 10 more days to finish this army. But I'm feeling pretty good about it. We got a Warmachine event on Sunday the 26th. So I'm definitely going to take part of that day off to play Warmachine. But other than that, I think we can do it.
