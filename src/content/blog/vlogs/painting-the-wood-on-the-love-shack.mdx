## The Time Crunch

I need to get some paint on this because I want to do snow effects, and those need to be dry in time. So I'm getting all the wood done tonight, metals tomorrow, and probably snow tomorrow too.

## The Weathered Wood Recipe

Following one of my favorite recipes for old wood from Marco Frisone. I'm going to dry brush this since I don't want to get the airbrush out for just one model.

The colors:
1. **Vanilla White** (from Scale Artist) with a big makeup brush
2. **Plaguebearer Flesh** contrast
3. **Guilliman Flesh** contrast
4. **Militarum Green** contrast

This gives us a nice weathered wood style for our Love Shack.

## The Dry Brush Foundation

This vanilla is a warm white with a little yellow mixed in. On the roof, I did the shading so the lower part would be darker. The back I also left a bit darker, but the sides, focal point on the front door, and very front I hit pretty hard.

## Applying Plaguebearer Flesh

Coming straight from the pot. I hit it with a heat gun first to make sure everything was dry—didn't want the contrast paint to mix with the white dry brush and make a goopy mess.

I'm not too worried about staying off the metal parts. At first it's going to be super flush, but we're going to do so much more to it.

## Guilliman Flesh

With this one, be more selective. I'm starting on the back so I can see how it's looking.

The painting contest is for a Winter Wonderland Warmachine event. I'm going for best painted champion and entering best painted objective too. I just don't have time to go crazy hard on the objective, but I still want it to look good.

I'm coming in where shadows will be first—top and bottom. I'm almost stippling it into the cracks because I'm going so fast. Should really wait for stuff to dry, so I have to be careful not to strip the paint.

## The Wet Blending Technique

We're almost wet blending these two contrast paints together. If you're not careful, it can get nasty looking fast. We've got very high contrast now, which for an objective will be pretty eye-catching.

This is just from two contrast paints and dry brushing! Pretty crazy for a speed paint approach.

## Finishing with Militarum Green

This goes in the shadows really. Just walking it down a little on the lower sections, leaving the middle alone.

I'm doing the least amount of green because we don't want it to actually look green—we just want it to add to the weathered effect.

## The Result

Very dirty, worn, and grungy Love Shack. A well-used Love Shack, if you will.

I might need to hit it with dry brush again and fix some coffee stains from going too fast. But for speed painting, trying to get as much done as possible, I think it looks pretty good so far.

## Tomorrow's Plan

For snow, I'm going to use crushed glass—which is a pain because you need gloves, mask, and resin. We'll figure it out!
