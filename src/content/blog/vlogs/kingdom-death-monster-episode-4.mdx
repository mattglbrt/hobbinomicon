## Quick Note on Content

If you're getting sick of Kingdom Death, don't worry—going back to more traditional hobby content soon. I need to finish the Infinity Commission and start painting these KDM minis.

My plan: at least one KDM video every two or three days, plus regular hobby content. This game is scratching so many itches. If you're on the fence, definitely pick it up.

## The Hunt Setup

This time we have terrain:
- **Grass** - Provides evasion
- **Bug patch** - Roll on a table
- **Debris pile** - Searchable

The lion starts with Ground Fighting—doesn't draw AI cards, but if a survivor activates in the death zone (one space around it), it performs a basic action.

### The Plan

1. New member searches the debris (she has nothing to lose)
2. Death Mask guy with darts shoots from range, fishing for crits
3. One-armed Orcus throws darts
4. Sophia the Strong with the club waits for the lion to come to her

## Debris Pile Jackpot

New girl searches the trash... rolls a 10. **Find rare gear: Scrap Sword!** The debris pile is archived. We're off to a great start.

## The Brutal Fight

The showdown was rough:

**Death Mask Toginus** lands a critical wound with fist and tooth, getting a persistent injury on the lion—fractured shoulder, -1 movement.

**Sophia** keeps missing with that bone club. Rolling sixes to hit and coming up empty repeatedly.

**Clinestra** (new girl with the scrap sword) becomes the unexpected hero, landing multiple wounds from the blind spot.

### Casualties

**Orcus** gets chomped. Both hits to the feet—heavy wound triggers injury table... **blood shoots from ephemeral artery. Dead in seconds.**

Bye-bye, Orcy. That's what you get for not hitting anything with those bone darts.

### The Kill

It comes down to Sophia the Strong and Clinestra. Sophia finally lands a hit with a 10—a lantern—and wounds the lion for the kill.

**Clinestra the Castrator** (earned that name) also nearly dead but survived.

## Settlement Event: Disaster

Rolling for year two settlement event... **Clinging Mist.** Rolled a 10.

Does the settlement have a Guidepost? No.

Returning survivors must either:
- Go on another hunt immediately without healing or changing gear
- Start a new settlement

I already cleared the sheets and healed them. Looking at the FAQ, if you can't heal, these two would probably die in one hit anyway.

**Time to start over.**

## Settlement Two: Hezekiah

New settlement name: Hezekiah. Fitting since the Castrator is deaf and Sophia has no jaw—she can't speak.

We keep all resources and gear from the hunt. Taking Cannibalize again since they're already cannibals.

### Building the New Team

**Sophia the Strong** - Full rawhide, bone club, +2 strength now (ate a sword beetle successfully!)

**Kipi Jr.** - Full rawhide, frenzy drink, inherited the scrap sword from Clinestra (who has to sit out)

**Death Mask Archer** - Catgut bow + death mask = crit fishing from range

**Support Character** - Cat eye circlet to reveal and reorder hit locations, staying in back

### Learnings

1. The bone club kept letting me down—Sophia did all her damage with fist and tooth before her jaw got broken
2. Sophia's +1 strength means she hits on fives, not sixes (I forgot this the entire last fight!)
3. Ground Fighting is great for us when we have ranged weapons

## Final Thoughts

Only have six population now instead of 13. Much lower margin for error.

But I'm deeper in love with this game than ever. The emergent storytelling—Sophia the Strong earning her bruiser identity through gameplay, Clinestra becoming the Castrator, the narrative of loss and survival—this is exactly what I wanted from solo gaming.

Back to the hunt.
