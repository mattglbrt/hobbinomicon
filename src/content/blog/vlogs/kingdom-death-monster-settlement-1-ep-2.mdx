## A Second Board Hits the Table

Going through the settlement establishment procedure. Our survivor who popped the lion pretty good got +1 survival, but at that time the cap was only one. I wrote two on his sheet, but had to correct it—don't want to cheat.

Now using tally marks in the survival limit box instead of writing numbers.

## The Settlement Phase

Following the process:
- Everybody heals up (except permanent injuries—Sophia the Strong is missing her jaw)
- We gain three Endeavor tokens (one per returning survivor)
- Update the timeline—first lantern year complete

## Language Innovation

The returning survivors trigger a story event. Someone steps forward and gains +1 courage, leading the others in learning to speak.

Since Sophia's jaw is broken, she's not starting the first words. Rolling to decide: Collip steps up to get everybody talking.

The Language card unlocks six more cards tagged with "language" for our innovation deck.

### The Lantern Horde

Armed with language, the nominated survivor names the gathering center—the Lantern Horde.

But here's the catch: because Collip was the speaker, she gets +1 understanding and +1 courage... but must sit out the next hunt. She has to stay at the Lantern Horde.

They tricked me!

## Starting Population

Rolled a seven on the d10—that's 10 unnamed survivors plus our returning survivors. 13 total population. I like the record keeping aspect—the spreadsheet boy in me is satisfied.

## Principal Death

Our first death triggers the Principal Death milestone. Two options:
1. **Eat the body** - Everyone gets +3 insanity, gain a founding stone. Roll for possible permanent +1 speed.
2. **Make a grave** - Departing survivors get +1 survival and understanding. Roll for possible permanent +1 luck.

Leaving it to the dice: 1-5 cannibals, 5+ bury the body.

**We're cannibals.** Rolled a one on the follow-up, so no bonus speed, but everyone gets +3 insanity and we're now officially insane survivors.

The Cannibalize principle also gives +1 survival limit and whenever a survivor dies, we draw one basic resource.

## Building Our Settlement

With three endeavors, we build:
- **Bonesmith** - Bone weapons and basic gear
- **Organ Grinder** - Complex materials
- **Skinnery** - Armor crafting

Looking at what we can craft with our resources... the specific White Lion drops aren't used in basic recipes. The shimmering mane can be archived for two hides.

Important discovery: when you spend resources, they go back in the box—they don't get shuffled back. Finite resources means thinking carefully about what to craft.

## First Impressions

I'm truly already in love with this game. The record keeping, the story elements, the meaningful choices. I haven't even looked at the custom survivor building yet—that was the main reason I originally bought it!

But now I just want to get back to playing.

This is now a Kingdom Death channel. You thought it was a hobby vlog? Nope, Kingdom Death.

(Just kidding, still a hobby vlog. But definitely more KDM content coming.)
