## Toad and Bases Going

Mixed up a little too much resin, so I filled in the bottoms of the base molds. Already starting to harden.

Thinking those bases will be easier to cast now that they're solid.

## Learning As We Go

Some silicone got up underneath the bases. We'll see what we get. We're learning, wasting a little bit, but worst case I'll cut it up and put it in other molds to reuse.

## Wholesale Discovery

Found a wholesale supplier of all the Smooth-On stuff—20 minutes away! Going to get a wholesale account and hopefully buy casting stuff way cheaper than Amazon.

If that's the case, I'm officially turning into a caster because this is awesome.

I guess I probably have to sell some stuff to make it look like a legit business. It IS a legit business, IRS. This is all tax deductible.

## The Results

Pop them out—these look great! Obviously got to clean up the one I overfilled, but these turned out awesome.

The bases are a lot heavier now, which is good. Should keep magnets in better too. Win on the overspill.

## Almost Perfect Toads

Getting very good at casting frogs. Almost no air bubbles—might be perfect...

Oh no. Bubble on the foot. Bubble on both feet. I take it back, don't have it locked in yet.

## Next Step: Vacuum Pot

Pretty happy overall. Going to get a vacuum pot in the next couple days and see the difference that makes.
