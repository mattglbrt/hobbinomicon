## Transcript

All right. So, Toad's going and bases are going, but I mixed up a little bit too much. So, I filled in the bottoms. That one I didn't do a good job filling in. But I filled in the bottoms and it's already starting to harden. And what I was thinking is that now that those bases will hopefully be solid, they'll be easier to cast.

I'm a little bit worried about how these other ones are going to turn out because some of the silicone got like up underneath the bases, which I don't know. We'll see what we get. I didn't think I had that much silicone. I don't know. We're learning. We're wasting a little bit, but worst case, I'll just cut it up and put it in other molds so I can reuse it.

I also found a wholesale supplier of like all the casting, all the Smooth-On stuff in my area right down the street. Not down the street, but like 20 minutes away. So then I can go get a wholesale account from them. So then I can buy all the casting stuff. Hopefully way cheaper than I can get on Amazon. And if that's the case, I'm officially turning into a caster because this is awesome.

I guess I probably got to sell some stuff to make it look like a legit business. It is a legit business. IRS. It is not a hobby. It's a legit business. This is all tax deductible.

All right. We're all hardened. Let's see. Pop them out. If I can do it one-handed. I spilled a little bit, but that's okay. I need to do a little bit of cleanup and I'll get some better lighting photos of these.

But these look great. Like these are awesome. Obviously I got to clean up that one that I overfilled. But these turned out great. And these are doing good, too. They're also a lot heavier. So I'm happy from that perspective. And I'll hopefully keep my magnets in better, too. So, that's a win on my overspill, too.

And I'm getting very good at casting frogs. So this like almost no air bubbles. This might be like perfect. A little bit of stuff on the bottom to clean up, but that's just going to be normal. I think I've got this locked in.

Oh no, there's a bubble on the foot. Bubble on both feet. I take it back. I don't have it locked in yet.

But I'm pretty happy. So, now I think I'm going to get a vacuum pot. So, the next time I cast I'll hopefully have a vacuum pot in the next couple of days. And we'll see the difference that makes.
