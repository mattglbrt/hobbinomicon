## Day Four Comfort

Already feeling more comfortable saying my thoughts out loud. Hopefully soon I'll also be entertaining at the same time.

## Magnetizing Bases

Before leaving this morning, magnetized all my bases that had magnet slots. Just super glue magnets together.

**Tip**: Super glue leaves white residue when it dries, so put it on printer paper.

## A Little Creepy?

I may or may not have printed off a couple YouTube comments and framed them. Shoutout to Trent for that.

It's not super creepy that a grown 35-year-old man is printing off YouTube comments and framing them... right? That's where we're at, guys.

## The Molly Crew Board Problem

Picked it up this morning—exactly what I feared happened. The spaces between blocks didn't actually stick. The porous foam just sponged up the glue.

**Lesson**: Don't use this mystery foam. Use XPS or pink insulation foam instead.

It's locked to the bottom but still flexible. Need to add rigidity underneath and frame around the edges.

## The Plan

1. Found latex-based spray primer that won't melt the foam
2. Blasted 4-5 coats before leaving
3. Will throw Mod Podge and Elmer's glue over everything
4. Want to keep the foam's natural stone texture
5. Build a shadow box or get a thick picture frame

Once framed, individual squares being loose won't matter as much.

## Weekend vs Weekday Hobby

Weekends are rough—so little time. During the week I have more time to dig into stuff.

Tomorrow's video will hopefully be more concrete real hobby content!
