## Transcript

So that part—just like seeing the homies—was fun. And I'll cut in some footage. The store we went to was out at the beach. And also before I left this morning, I magnetized the bases of all of my dudes that had magnet slots in them. And then I just take a magnet and I use super glue and I glue them together. And really the only tip I have for this is that the super glue leaves that like white residue when it dries. So I just put it on top of some printer paper.

And definitely on day four, I'm already feeling more comfortable saying my thoughts out loud. And hopefully soon I'll also be entertaining at the same time to where it's cool and worth listening to. But just thanks for the support so far. Everybody who's watching—really cool. I may or may not have printed off a couple of comments. So hopefully that—just as like a thank you and appreciation over to Trent for that—and it's not super creepy that I'm a grown 35-year-old man printing off YouTube comments and framing them. But that's where we're at, guys.

I do want to talk about the Motley Crews board, too, though. So I picked it up this morning and was playing with it and exactly what I was afraid happened happened and the spaces between the two blocks did not actually like stick. It looks like it just went into the block themselves and they sponged it up. So the block—and I've never used this foam before and if you want to do this yourself, don't use that porous foam. Like go use XPS or pink insulation foam and use that and then no problem because like we know how that works. But this stuff is mystery foam and it stuck to the bottom—like it's locked in. Like it's stacked in place from that perspective but it's flexible. So, I need to put some rigidity on the bottom, which again, I knew I was gonna have to do. I'm going to do some kind of frame around the edges to lock it in that way. But then I'm also going to figure out a way to just make it more cohesive together and like bricked up.

So, I found some latex-based spray primer. I checked it just to make sure it wasn't going to melt the whole board. And I just blasted it out—like I put four or five coats just like back to back. Like literally blasted it before I left to go play Trench Crusade today. And hopefully when I get back that is dried and I can start.

I'm really—I'm just going to throw like a bunch of different Mod Podge and more Elmer's glue on it and try to like build a seal over top of the whole thing so that I still like—I keep as much of the detail because I actually like the texture of the foam which is what made me save it. It's almost already like a stone texture. And but just try to like thin down some Mod Podge is probably what I'll do over the top so it can like build a seal that one—like paint's going to stick to easier and actually like bind it all together.

And I'm thinking if I did my cuts and measurements right, it's going to be 10 inches by 10 inches. I might try to—or I'm definitely going to build a shadow box, but I might already have like a cool shadow box or get like some thick picture frame from the thrift store so it has a cool border around it that way. So by at that point everything will be locked in and then it won't be as important if the individual squares are locked in at that point.

So that's what I'm thinking for that project. And it's really like—I think I'm probably gonna—I'm going to paint them in the same style as the permadeath mini where like non-metallic metal but like fast mode. And I'll probably try to play around with some more of these Army Painter contrast paints. So I think that'll be fun.

But just like the weekends are so rough. Like I don't have such little time on the weekends but during the week I have more time to spend painting and actually like digging into stuff. So, I'm hoping the next video, tomorrow's video will be more of like some concrete, real hobby.
