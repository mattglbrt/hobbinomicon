## The Idea That's Coming

I've been having this weird feeling all week that I'm about to get an idea. I don't know what the idea is, but I can feel it there. It's like I know the inspiration is brewing and something big is coming, but I just can't figure out what it is.

It's driving me crazy.

## The Lego Base Experiment

I've been on the Lego thing lately and I've got this official D&D Lego minifigure. In my head, it was going to be very easy to cut this base, pop in a two-spot piece, try to cast it, and make my own bases.

But then I started thinking: **why not just use Legos to make a base?**

### The Discovery

Messing around with Lego pieces, the colors aren't ideal, but it's only about a millimeter bigger than a standard base. On a Chessex grid, that's close enough.

And here's the thing—on a game mat amongst normal miniatures, am I cooking here? I don't know.

Then imagine the whole scene built in Lego too.

### The Reality Check

After doing this, I Googled it. This is definitely already a thing. This is how people make bases for Lego D&D. I don't know what I was thinking it would be revolutionary, but it was fun messing around with it.

## Still Searching

Still haven't found Rangers of Shadow Deep. Tore everything apart. Two books are just missing, which makes me think I took them somewhere to read them. If I had to guess, probably my daughter's room because she likes to take my books to look at.

## What's Next

I've been researching a ton of solo and co-op games. Thanks everybody who commented and DM'd me with suggestions. Tomorrow I'm going to present my results.

Sleep first though—getting a little delirious here.
