## Transcript

All right, it's finally time. This is my new favorite plastic glue. Pour type Mr. Cement S, fast drying, low viscosity. And I also like the Mr. Hobby Mr. Cement Deluxe. It has like resin in it, so sometimes you can gap fill with it. Let's get into it.

Okay, all the goblins are built. It's 11:23 p.m. I'm going to try to get them all on bases and get this video posted before midnight. I'll be back hopefully.

All right, I got a little bit left. But I'm going to stop recording and get this edited so I can post it and make sure I actually get my video in for today. But we are definitely going to be good and I will have much cooler video starting tomorrow. We're finally through the 18 hours of tedious parts, and tomorrow the videos are going to start finally getting cool again. Thanks for watching.
