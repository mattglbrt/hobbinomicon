## Finally Time

This is my new favorite plastic glue—Pour Type Mr. Cement S, fast setting, low viscosity. I also like Mr. Hobby Mr. Cement Deluxe, which has resin in it so you can gap fill with it.

Let's get into it.

## 11:23 PM - All Goblins Built

All the goblins are built. Going to try to get them all on bases and get this video posted before midnight.

## Done With the Tedious Part

Got a little bit left, but stopping recording to edit and post. We're definitely going to be good.

Through the 18 hours of tedious parts. Tomorrow the videos are going to start finally getting cool again.

Thanks for watching.
