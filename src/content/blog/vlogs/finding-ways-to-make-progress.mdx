## Full Circle

This right here is the first Warhammer model I ever got—one of the goblins from the Goblin Regiment box for Warhammer sixth edition. I still have it. Obviously I never got around to actually painting him, and I think that says a lot.

This is one of the very first models I ever painted. It's been stripped and repainted once, twice, maybe three times already. I think now it's time to strip it one more time and paint it again.

## The October Project

For October, I am finally going to have the orc and goblin army that I dreamed of when I was a kid. While waiting for my airbrush problems to sort themselves out, I cleaned off my workspace and pulled everything out. I'm going to get this organized—some of it's been sitting for years—and finally paint it for this month.

## When Strategy Blocks You

I'm still working on my Call to Arms stuff. I have an idea in my head of how I wanted to paint it, and it requires an airbrush. I just couldn't get past the strategy of how I was going to paint it. I was trying to think of alternate schemes or ways I could do it, but I put so much time into thinking through how I was going to do it that I was really hung up on it.

The last couple of days I've been slamming videos in right before midnight just because the days have been so crazy. I didn't want to lose my streak.

## Finding Progress Anyway

I was like, "What am I going to do to keep the hobby streak going, to still get hobby progress?" I was really struggling to get anything done or even paint. I didn't want to let the airbrush thing stop me from making progress.

So I got the space ready to get everything built and start basing done. I also finished the kit bash.

## The Kit Bash

I cleaned up that pole so it's straight now—just put a bunch sprue glue on it and shaped it up. Cleaned up the foot, got the base handled. A couple minor gaps are all filled in with sprue glue and sanded.

I absolutely love how he turned out and I'm excited to get some paint on him. He's going to be part of a whole Inquisitorial warband after this month.

## Avoiding Project Hopping

I was running out of ideas but didn't want to start a whole new crazy project because it felt like project hopping. In the past I have project hopped so much that nothing gets done.

I've kind of done that due to time constraints because Call to Arms made me stop working on the board project. But I'm going to finish the board project. I should have a working airbrush again shortly.

## What's Coming

While waiting to figure out the airbrush, I'm going to start building the Orc and Goblin project. That's the next thing I'll actually paint after Call to Arms.

I've got longer form videos and more well-produced and edited videos that I've been working on and piecing together. Those are coming later in the month. The vlog thing I'm mostly doing for myself, whereas the long form videos are going to try to be actual quality pieces.

## The Lesson

Don't let minor setbacks keep you down. You can always find something to do to make progress.
