## Transcript

So this is my first ever Warhammer model. It's a little—it's in a rough state, but it was from the Goblin Regiment box for 6th edition. And I actually wanted to get Lizardmen, but Lizardmen was too expensive, so I got this box instead. But I've been wanting to paint an orc and goblin army for as long as I can remember. Definitely for several years now. And October is Orctober. And I know I said I was going to finish my Call to Arms army, but this is my Orctober project announcement and I'm probably going to paint an orc and goblin army this month as well.

So right now, where we're at on the workbench, the airbrush situation has really been holding me back. You know, I'm waiting on parts for one airbrush, which will probably come in tomorrow because it's been about a week. And the airbrushing situation has held me back a lot this week. And I've been looking for ways to make progress. And I did find some progress. So the kitbash we were working on, that is done.

There's a little bit more green stuff and cleanup that needs to happen. I haven't painted my nails in a week because I'm doing this stuff constantly and there's no point. But yeah, we're basically done. This is just going to be waiting until I can airbrush him. And I'm actually going to airbrush him along with the whole Inquisitorial army or warband as well. So, he'll get primed along with the rest of the team.

And so speaking of airbrushing, I went to use the Ice King's airbrush tonight. And the Ice King, a good friend of the show, gave me his—well, loaned me—his airbrush and his compressor. And he threw in some paints for me to use as well just to see if I like airbrushing with them. And I went to set it up and there's a part missing. So, I've ordered that part. It's like a connection part for the hose. But I need that before I can do anything with this.

So it's really airbrush central. Like we're just circling around the drain waiting for these things to come in. And in the meantime, I am cleaning the house up, going through all my hobby stuff and reorganizing things. You could see behind me over here I've got the IKEA shelf going up. I'm about to fill that up and get more.

And since I'm going to have more time to talk here and since I've been holding this back for a little bit, I want to talk about longer form content. So, these are vlogs. These are like daily-ish videos. But when I have a big project, I'm going to put together some like quality—not that these aren't quality—but like real effort videos—not that this isn't effort—but you know, longer form videos, actual like things that people can watch and get some value out of, not just hang out.

So, the long form content will be more tutorial based. Basically, stuff that's not really conducive to the vlog format will be packaged into that. And I'll be releasing those at some point here. I have to do more work on my editing and I need some more tools for that. But keep your eyes out for that and it's just basically like the way I explain it is when I have something that's really not going to fit well within a vlog or isn't going to fit multiple vlogs, or is something that I really want people to be able to find long term, I'll make it into a special video.

But yeah, that's where we're at. Just finding ways to make progress and trying to keep pushing. So, whatever is holding you back, just find a way to work around it, and let's go.
