## Back in the Dungeon

I'm finally back in the dungeon. Not 100%—going to be a while before I'm 100%—but I've got water, I've got coffee, and I've got a ton of parts to remove support lines from and get glued together and on bases. Time to get really hobby again.

## Two Hours of Progress

Got a solid 2 hours in. This Trench Crusade warband is going to be my next project—I need this in January. I might need more Yogi and Wretches, but otherwise that's pretty much done. Got all these built with supports removed.

This guy is solid. Freaking massive. My 40 millimeters are curing right now, then I'll pop those on in a minute.

## The Crucible Guard Army

This is my first 50-point Crucible Guard list—caster, three jacks, two Toros, Suppressor, the Triumvirate Alice. It's probably the only 50-point list you could run and have it actually working with what's currently available.

Maybe you could play with some lights, but you pretty much need three jacks. I think it probably has to be this caster if you want to have a chance because you need the points from the jacks to even be able to play 50 points. It's really interesting choices they made on what they released so far.

## The Next 30 Days

Got all those built plus an extra 30mm base for when the other stuff comes out. This is what I'm starting the year off with:

- Trench Crusade—need it probably in the next couple of weeks because that campaign's going to start soon
- This 50-point Crucible Guard list painted for a narrative event
- Crucible Guard all the way next year—not going to do Dusk, just don't want to have to buy any more stuff
- We'll play Dusk probably 2027 when all of Fain is out
- An Infinity Commission due at the end of January

So that's going to be the next 30 days of the channel.

## Other Projects in Progress

The board you can see in the background is still drying with oil. When that's totally dry, I'll paint the rim and that'll be good to go. Then I'll start making stuff to go on top of it.

And then our Dolmenwood party right there—Dolmenwood is coming soon, going to get that painted.

## Wrapping Up

This is the next couple of days of painting. Get this primed today—probably won't record it just because it's priming. But then tomorrow, finally painting again.

I sound terrible, but I'm not actually sick anymore, which is pretty cool. Just hoping to get the rest of the stuff out of my chest and back to normal.

This was a very successful hobby day. Hope you guys had a good holiday, whatever you celebrate going into the new year. Thanks to the 200 people that watched me oil washing the board on Christmas—I don't know what YouTube was doing showing that video to that many people, but that's crazy. Thanks for being here!
