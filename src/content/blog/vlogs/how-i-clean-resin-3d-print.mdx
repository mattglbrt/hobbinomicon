## Transcript

Okay, so here's how I clean my resin prints. First thing I do is I take everything off the build plate. And then the build plate's a mess, right? Covered in resin. So what I do first is I take my tray, fill it with some denatured ethanol, and then I take the wash tray. I clean it really good. I'll take—after I get it all washed—I'll take my regular cleaning pad and get all the residue off.

And then it goes into the Elegoo wash station. And I fill up the wash station with denatured ethanol—denatured alcohol. It's the same thing. Fill up the Elegoo wash station and I set it to about four minutes. Sometimes I set it to two minutes, take it out, reposition, and then run it for another two minutes.

When they're done cleaning, I take them out and put them in a big tub of really hot water. And then I slosh them around just to get all of the denatured ethanol off. I use a paper towel to make sure there's absolutely nothing on them. And the point of that is: when they go into the curing station, if there's any denatured alcohol on them, it can turn white. The print can turn white.

So, once they're really clean, I take them and I put them into the curing station on top of a turntable. And then I let them cure. The Siraya Tech Build resin that I use, I think it's around eight minutes on the curing station. And then they are cured. You can tell because they should be completely matte. If there's any shiny spots on the model when it comes out of the curing station—like the model looks glossy—that means there's still uncured resin on it, and you probably want to wash it again.
