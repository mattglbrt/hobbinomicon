## Captain Rahara List Ideas

With the new patch, Captain Rahara's defense is crazy high now. The big question with the lethality update: does that high defense actually matter?

Her Gang Fighter is changing, and her feat gives everybody in her control range another attack—melee or ranged, which is pretty cool.

### Key Spells

- **Carnage** - Plus two MAT, one of the few casters who kept it
- **Curse of Shadows** - Minus two armor
- **Hunter's Mark** - Increases threat range
- **Rough Seas** - Super important with that high defense

### List Components

**Scavenger** becomes very interesting with Carnage and Finisher. It's very fast, and the MAT drops to six with the update, but Carnage pushes it up two, then Finisher gives three more.

**Blood Priestess** - The main point isn't Arcane Assist, it's Temptations of Fate which gives Rahara a sucker for assassination protection.

**Blood Witches** kept Gang, which might be an oversight. With Gang, Carnage, Ambush, and Dark Shroud, they get pretty crazy. They also have 13 defense now.

## Thyra List Building

For Thyra, I'm looking at a different approach:

- **Blood of Martyrs** - When it gets in combat, it's going to kill something
- **Sanctifier** - Can get souls from the 24 infantry bodies in the list
- **14 Shield Guards** in two separate units
- **Nilla** with Revive and Aberration doing their thing

The concept: can you remove 28 bodies before I Tactician with Ferris and charge these jacks through those bodies at you? With synergy and maxed focus, is that good enough against Mark IV factions?

## Fifth Division Thoughts

Fifth Division seems the most like a "real list" that's not silly or a gimmick or relying too much on one thing.

I've decided I'm definitely going to play Legacy because I think we're probably getting close to Legacy going bye-bye. My Menoth is painted to a very high standard, so I could easily play that and paint something else.

## Crucible Guard Update

Crucible Guard got nerfed pretty hard. A lot of the stuff I was excited to play got hit. I'm going to still finish painting them because I like how they look and they're fun to paint, but I'm not as excited about them as I was going in.

It's actually cool that they released that patch before people started paying for them.

## Final Thoughts

Statistics and Thyra are what I'm most excited about. Rahara and Thyra really are my top picks. Fifth Division is probably going to be in the best spot of what I have—it seems the most balanced and not like a gimmick list.

I want to try these crazy lists on the tabletop before switching into Fifth Division to see if that high defense matters and how important keeping Carnage really is.
