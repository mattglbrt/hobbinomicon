## Today's Plan

Today is all about building and cleaning. Got some models that need assembling and the workspace could always use more organization.

## The Building Queue

Working through the pile of unbuilt models. It's satisfying to make progress on the backlog, even if it feels never-ending sometimes.

## Cleaning Progress

The hobby space is slowly but surely getting more organized. Every little bit helps, and it makes such a difference when you can actually find your tools and supplies.

## Small Wins

Days like this are about making incremental progress. Not every day needs to be about painting a masterpiece—sometimes just getting things built and organized is a win.
