## Transcript

I have a vision now, which is something I was lacking before besides just uploading every day. Almost have usable green screen. I've got all the shelves—not clean, but like I got all this room, all the floors clean, all the sacks of books, all the boxes. I probably give you motion sickness. I have spent all my available time cleaning up the floor, and now I just need to organize shelves and the table. But it's exciting.

Back today. I finished building the Final Hunt. I still have to do this last cat, but it is about to hit midnight and I didn't want to miss the upload. So, this is—oh, let me not get a glare on it. This is what they actually look like. Very excited to paint these. These are very cool models. They're Dusk Warmachine models—very obviously inspired by D&D Drow. I don't know, I can't imagine who inspired those.

Because of that, I'm feeling pretty inspired even just beyond Warmachine. That's going to be the next army that I play. But tomorrow—tomorrow's video: Crown and Skull. I'm going to generate a party for a solo playthrough of Crown and Skull, which I've been wanting to do and putting off for a very long time. So, if you're unfamiliar with that, definitely going to go through Crown and Skull. I have volume two as well, but mostly just going to be going through volume one. And that's the job for tomorrow. So, thanks for watching. See you then.
