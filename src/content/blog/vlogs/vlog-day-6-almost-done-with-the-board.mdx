## 5 AM Airbrushing

Starting day six getting this board into the final stretch. Primed gray (not black) because I want the overall board pretty bright.

## The Basalt Effect

Looking at reference photos, basalt looks like it was shaded with an airbrush in real life. So:

1. **White primer** - Hit the middle of squares
2. **Burnt umber** - Around edges, getting between all the cracks
3. **Pale blue gray** - Over the top

On video it looks like the pre-shading was washed out, but it's still there—very cool effect in real life. Trust me.

## Three Colors of Stone

Now visually balancing three different stone colors. Going to hit everything with a wash, then dry brush the same color to unify it.

Having three different colors makes it seem more organic—stone isn't the same color everywhere. No formula, just eyeballing what looks good and spacing them around.

## The Magic: Dark Streaking Grime

Slathering dark streaking grime over everything. Hit it with a heat gun to accelerate dry time. Once mostly dried, come back with a sponge—remove most from the middle of stones, let it stay in cracks.

This is the magic that makes it actually look like stone.

## Green Wash Experiment

Thinking about adding green wash in certain parts for a moldy/tinged look. Experimenting on different parts of the board to see what works.

Coming down to the wire for the video going live—want it to dry and do more work before posting!
