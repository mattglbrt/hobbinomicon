## No-Nonsense Pale Orc Flesh Guide

Here's how to paint grim dark pale orc flesh fast and effectively.

## The Spit Effect Secret

If you want cool spit effects, it's just UHU glue on the model. Dab it on with a toothpick. That easy.

## The Recipe

1. **Base coat**: Pallid Wych Flesh all over
2. **Pink areas**: Mix Quick Shade Wash Medium with Bugman's Glow 50/50. Put on mouth, hands, elbows—anywhere that would be pinker flesh
3. **Streaking grime**: Cover the whole model
4. **Wipe away**: Use a sponge and Q-tip to remove the grime. This is what turns the skin green
5. **Mineral spirits**: Come back on the very tops of muscles, teeth, and nails
6. **Highlights**: Menoth White (P3) on nails, teeth, and tops of muscles (especially shoulders)
7. **Optional**: Small wash of Carroburg Crimson on the Bugman's Glow areas
8. **Eyes**: White dot for beady little eyes

## Very Fast, Very Effective

This method is especially fast if you have an airbrush—just airbrush Pallid Wych Flesh and you're basically done except for the streaking grime.

I made this guide while painting my Age of Sigmar orcs army-wide. Just took pictures so I wouldn't forget what I was doing.

## Extra Time on Faces

Spending just 20 extra minutes on a face gets really good results. The more green they come out, the more that pale color still shows through.

## Goblin Update

All the black is done on the goblins. Didn't get to skin today—son got sick, so I was hanging out keeping him happy. Tomorrow's Warmachine day!
