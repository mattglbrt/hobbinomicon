## Chaos Recovery

The dogs can apparently open the door handle down here. They got into the game room and it was much worse than what you're seeing. I've lost all the dice - assuming the cat was batting them around.

Found enough dice to continue. Going to figure out a better setup and start locking the door.

## Building the Screaming Antelope

Fun build! Did some on the couch while recovering. Little bit of sanding on the head and some gap filling with Mr. Hobby Glue. Got him drying.

It's a wonky pose - might need to pin it to the base since it's not supporting itself yet.

## The Hunt Phase

### Teething Event

The survivors find a trail of large rotting teeth. Each survivor may scavenge:

- **Sophia** rolls 10 - Gets an intact tooth! One large screaming antelope resource off the bat
- **Theren** rolls 6 - Finds nothing
- **Alexios** rolls 10 - Gets a large flat tooth
- **Kip** rolls 3 - Suffers one event damage to the arms (no armor there - could be bad if she loses an arm before using the bow)

### Grim and Frostbitten

Dead stillness in the air. Thick with worry. Bitter evil cold with no shelter.

Unless a survivor has armor at each hit location, they lose survival. Kip loses 1 survival (down to 1). Everyone else in full armor is fine.

### The Beginning

The survivors stumble upon the scene of their settlement's first hunt. Seeing the spot of their first triumph is electrifying.

Each survivor gains +1 survival. Nice recovery for Kip - back up to 2.

### Hunt Complete

Nothing caused the antelope to move. We encounter it ready to fight.

## Recovery Update

Still taking it easy from the vasectomy, but got the antelope built and almost all the new survivors ready. Planning to start painting them this week.

Tomorrow: the actual Screaming Antelope showdown!
