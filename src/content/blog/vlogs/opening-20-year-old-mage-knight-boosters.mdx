## The Booster Draft Dilemma

I've been thinking I wanted to do a booster draft with these Mage Knight boosters, but realistically there's just nobody I'm going to be able to play with. So I'm going to use the official solo rules and do booster draft style to get my party.

I'll open these three right now—those will be my heroes for the solo rules. I'm still a little bit sick at time of recording, so this is a little Christmas time treat for myself.

## First Pack: A Unique!

If I remember right, there's definitely a hero in each one, and you build a 100-point team. Oh—we pulled a unique right off the rip! Hell yeah, Azo Tento's Reaper. This is a unique in Mage Knight. Very cool. It's crazy to be ripping uniques all these years later.

This is a Secrets of Cairo thief if I remember correctly. Yeah, stealth, sneak attack, dodge. So that's good—we got our thief, our guy to open up treasure chests. Obviously we'll need that.

What else? A pot belly gremlin and a wear saber-tooth cat. Sweet, those will be good. Pot belly gremlins are such a pain in the ass to destroy.

## Second Pack: The Mage Blaster

This time we got Medusa—a good mage blaster. And Norforthought—we got to stay away from the thoughts. This guy gets very good once he turns level three. It's always cool playing with the trolls.

Oh, we got a broken Medusa sword too. So far, if that last guy is a melee guy, we're going to have a pretty well-rounded team here. Got a skeleton archer, mage spawn pool. Those are looking pretty decent.

## Third Pack: Building the Team

Boom—there's the wear saber-tooth cat. Pretty sick! I actually wanted both of these two for the collection. I needed them on the rebuild. And getting a unique is always cool—was always impossible pulling uniques out of packs as a kid.

We got a pretty decent chunk. If we were playing in a draft, we'd be coming in pretty hot honestly because these guys can't be shot, and these guys get stronger as they go.

## The 97-Point Party

So he's 32 points, he's 35—that's 67—and then this guy's 30. So we're at 97 points for three dudes at level two. We have two thieves. This guy's just kind of a beast—he gets magic blast so he can shoot through walls. He's tough and also has a 10-3 in melee.

He's going to be our bruiser while these guys are sneaking and stabbing and opening up treasure chests.

## The Strategy

This guy and this guy are actually pretty much the same—this guy's literally just a better version of this guy. But this guy's stats get pretty hard to kill. 10 movement is no joke. 10 attack, sneak attack, and then 17 with dodge. He could be very hard to actually damage.

I'm probably not even going to worry about giving this guy experience points to level up. I'm just going to dump all my experience into our bruiser to kill stuff because once he gets going—and we want to keep him alive.

This guy's kind of expendable. We don't really care about him. The other guy will probably get our first level because he gets that 10 movement. He starts already pretty high at nine, but when he goes to 10 with nine attack, he's going to be able to run around grabbing treasure, disarming traps, and getting out of the dungeon.

Here's our heroes—this will be fun!
