## Final Glue Layer

Back in the garage. I'm going to hit this board one more time with a full layer of the glue spray because it's only going to help lock it in more. Then I think we'll be done.

It's pretty solid as is. After this layer, I'll feel totally comfortable spray painting it.

I'm going pretty hard now because I know there's a pretty good layer, and any exposed parts I want to soak up. Just to give you an idea—it's pretty thick. Don't want any air bubbles. I'll go back and pop those.

## The Vulcan Finally Printed

Vulcan finally printed. No problems! Going to let this dry off. I'll probably magnetize this. I think I have all the jacks that I actually play printed.

After I get the Railless Interceptors done, I'll go back and probably just go full field allowance. But I got to buy some more resin again.

## Tabletop Ready

Hey look—it's ugly as hell, but at tabletop I think we're pretty good. When you get super close, you know, it's still a little rough. I can probably file and sand away those marks. I thought I did a better job on the little round parts, but I'm pretty happy with it for my first time ever trying to merge STL files.

## Suddenly Sick

Between the time I left for work and now—I'm just getting home—I got sick as hell. So I'm going to go inside, feed everybody, and then go to sleep.

But hey—you curious? We're totally locked in though. The board is solid!
