## Finding the Monster

I didn't get a chance to prime the other guy this week, so I went through the bestiary and found this entry: a Wodewose—wild people of the forest, 6 to 7 feet tall, covered in coarse hair, moss, and lichen, wandering in the deep woods.

I've had this model already primed. I wanted to use it to test out slap chop because I thought it'd be a really good candidate. I've never gone full slap chop method before, so we're going to change that.

## The Slap Chop Setup

I'm using a pastel green instead of straight gray as our mid-tone, and Vanilla White for the highlights. Getting a big poofy dry brush and working this in real quick.

I want a little bit more color in here because I'm worried there's still a lot of black on this model. I don't want it to be crazy dark—I want it to still be bright and colorful while keeping that contrast in the feet.

## New Year Goals While Painting

I've been thinking about goals for the new year. A couple days in and I've had some broad ones in the back of my mind:

**Paint every day:** Before doing videos, I would have thought that's impossible. But I've been recording and editing a video every day. Sometimes it seems like too much to paint, but if I can make a video every day, I can definitely get paint on a model every day.

**Paint or sell everything:** Anything that's not painted by December 15th, I'm going to sell it, give it away, or trade it. The only exceptions are my Chainmail miniature collection (waiting to get the full collection before painting) and my Mage Knight Metals collection.

**Play more games:** I want to play at least a game every week, preferably two—including War Table and IRL games. I want to get at least one game of Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game with fully painted armies. Found a Discord group that plays online in Tabletop Simulator, so that might be the way.

## The Contrast Paint Conversion

I definitely have to say, after not being a fan of contrast paints or speed paints, now that I've used them more and learned how to use them, they're pretty awesome.

On that Crucible Guard jack, I airbrushed them, used them as inks, used them as washes, used them as glazes, base coated with them. Pretty awesome how versatile they are once you get comfortable and have the right tools. Definitely don't use a stable hair brush with them.

## Color Choices

- **Shamrock Green** on the feet—very bright, holy cow
- **Algae Green** for the skin tone—this is more what I was hoping for
- **Forest Sprite** on the body hair
- **Chartreuse** on the head hair—way more yellow than green, very cool
- **Familiar Pink** on the cloth—this is so translucent it actually looks kind of faded, like raggedy cloth

I almost feel like maybe these models were designed with slap chopping in mind. There are set texture areas that are kind of blocky—the model is mapped out in a way where you could very easily and quickly paint like this.

## The Model Origin Mystery

I love this model. I don't know where it came from—I got it as a gift. Someone said they got them from Amazon. I've had them since my birthday last year. They're the same kind of material as the Dolmenwood miniatures—gray, a little bit flexible, mostly hard, with pretty good detail.

If I can find out where they came from, I'll post it in the comments.

## The Result

There's no eyes on the model—nothing even sculpted in there. I kind of like keeping it dark like it's in shadow from the hair.

For a Dolmenwood campaign where this will probably be there to get merched by the party, pretty great for a quick evening of painting.

This is Dolmenwood Pokédex number one, day 114. Hope you have a good start to your new year. Catch you tomorrow when we're back to Warmachine.
