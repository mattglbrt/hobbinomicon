## Back With a Live One

It's been a crazy couple of days, so I had to dig into the vault of pre-recorded stuff. But today—Sunday—we're getting back to actual live content.

## Setup Clarification

Cleaned up the table. Now we're looking at a true 4x4 game space. If you have a Warmachine table, you're good. I'll be able to keep this set up forever since I'm the only one who comes down here.

### Resource Card Rules

Important clarification: when you pull resource cards and the rules say "put them back in the box," they're not actually archived gone forever. You spend them or document that you have them, then they go back so next time you fight the White Lion, you have the same likelihood of getting all the resources.

That makes me feel better about crafting.

## Gear Loadout Strategy

Not randomizing builds—a helpful comment warned me the game is random and difficult enough.

### My Logic

**Sophia the Strong gets all the armor.** Four pieces of rawhide going to one person because:
- Even with one piece each, survivors can still get killed on an unarmored hit location (like last time—Tmicus had cloth armor but got hit in the head and died)
- Two fresh characters with nothing on them? I don't care if they die
- If Sophia dies, I don't lose the gear anyway

**Weapons:**
- One bone darts for ranged support
- Three bones for a bone club on Sophia

Going all eggs in one basket with Sophia: full armor and the substantial melee weapon. The goal is a tank with range support, and two disposable characters along for the ride. Way better than last time.

## The Hunt Phase

Setting up the hunt board—every showdown has a little diagram showing card placement. We're choosing level one again.

### Hunt Events

**Prowling Lion** - The lion hunts something else. Move it one space away. Starts with Ground Fighting in play.

**Fields of Golden Grass** - Gained +1 courage but then had to roll on the event table.

**Heavy Mist** - Rolled odd, so we're lost. Roll again.

**Stone Feet** - This is where it gets wild. Insane survivors are convinced they've reached the underside of the world and clutch the ground for dear life. Roll once on the hunt event table for EACH insane survivor.

Only two of ours are insane (the new characters), so we got lucky.

### The Statue with the Sword

**Sword in the Statue** - A one-eyed statue twice as tall as any man with a hammer in each of its six hands, beating a red hot sword.

Orcus tries to grab it... rolls a two plus one hunt XP = three. Quick grab but not quick enough—**Dismembered Arm severe injury.** He loses his arm forever and gets a bleeding token.

Nobody else is attempting that.

### The Mask Salesman

A traveling mask salesman offers special wares. We shuffle the mask gear and draw... the **Death Mask**.

No affinities? Gain +4 luck but suffer -4 to all severe injury rolls.

The price? Archive one gear. Orcus loses his armor but gains the mask. Glass cannon build—if he gets hit he's probably dead, but he's going to roll a lot of crits.

I'm actually happy with that.

### Bold Story Event

Orcus triggered Bold from gaining courage. During the hunt phase, that gives him the "Prepared" ability—expect the unexpected. Rolled a seven for +1 understanding.

## Ready for the Showdown

The party:
- **Orcus** - Two survival, three insanity, one armor on waist, death mask, bone darts, courage and understanding boosted
- **Sophia the Strong** - Full rawhide armor, bone club, +1 strength
- **Clinton Extra** - Fresh character, just along for the ride
- **Collip** - Sitting out at the Lantern Horde

Innovations: Language only. Settlement Principle: Cannibalize.

Let's hunt.
