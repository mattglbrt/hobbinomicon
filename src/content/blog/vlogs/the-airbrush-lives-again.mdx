## Transcript

So, I spent 17 bucks on Amazon and now I have a working airbrush again. I've been out of the airbrush game for probably two years, maybe longer. I don't know. But I figured out the trick. It was a moisture trap. It has like a quick release adapter on the end of it and it just screws right onto the airbrush hose. And then on this side of it, you have this quick release and then the airbrush just plugs right in. So now I can super easily switch between multiple airbrushes and I can super easily take the airbrush off to clean the cup without having to unscrew it from the hose.

One thing I really like about it is that it has this spring-loaded action. So when you plug it in, it releases the pressure, and when you disconnect it, it holds the pressure. So you don't have to turn the compressor off every time you want to switch airbrushes or clean the cup.

This is an airbrush I borrowed from Ice King. So this is his backup airbrush. I have an old Iwata that I've been using for years, but I think it's time to retire it. So I'm going to try this one out and see how it goes. But yeah, 17 bucks and now the airbrush lives again.
