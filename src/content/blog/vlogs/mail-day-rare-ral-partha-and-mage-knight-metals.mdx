## Morning Resin Work

I love the smell of 3D printer resin in the morning. I desperately need to get a new respirator. Cleaning up some Crucible Guard today.

I wasn't going to start a new army, but I realized that in my going crazy and selling everything, I sold all of my Warmachine armies except for Menoth and the new Dusk stuff. It's going to be several months until I can play Dusk, and I don't want to play Menoth this year. So it's time to print a new army for myself.

Everything came out great except the back of this jack arm—the gun did misprint, so I have to reprint that. But everything else looks great.

## The Rare Unboxing

Today we have a quick unboxing of some pretty rare miniatures that I'm very happy to have found. Some of these I've never seen before, and some I've only seen in real life once—and I missed out on them. So I snagged them up this time.

This box came all the way from the frozen wastes of Canada. Very well packaged, thank you cool eBay seller!

## Mage Knight Metal Limited Editions

These are the Whirlwind and Lancers Mage Knight metal limited edition models. They're all metal. A lot of people don't even know that they did these later sets where all the cavalry is made in metal.

I've seen this one in person once, but I've never even seen these metal cavalry for sale anywhere. I've never seen the Heavy Cavalry for sale. Had to snatch those up for the collection.

I'm trying to get a full complete set of Mage Knight metals.

## Ral Partha Based on Mage Knight

A lot of the Mage Knight figures—especially Dungeons—have Ralph Partha and Iron Wind sculpts that aren't even marked as Mage Knight figures, but they are. These say "based on Mage Knight figures" and look at the typo on there!

These are also some pretty rare limited edition models:
- Morg Blood Spitter
- Barbara Herk
- Mortis Draconum—a sneaky big dragon guy with metal claws
- Half Troll Berserker—just a cool screaming orc

## The Collection Plan

A lot of people don't know these exist in my experience. If you're a Mage Knight fan, get out and try to find them—after I finish my set!

I'm keeping them sealed for now. Some of them I have loose. My plan is to collect them all and then go back and paint them all exactly how they look on the box art.

The Mage Knight metals and the Chainmail metals are really the only things I'm collecting and keeping in the box. Those were the two things that got me started in the hobby—it wasn't actually Warhammer figures.

## A Personal Note

I was so afraid and discouraged back then because I couldn't paint like the box art. Now, for the time those paint jobs were great and awesome—and I don't mean this to put anyone else down—but now I can paint better than what the box art is. And that's really cool.

So I'm going to try to collect them all, and then it'll probably be a year of Chainmail and Mage Knight eventually whenever I do get them all. Those are the only things I'm keeping. Everything else I'm dishing.
