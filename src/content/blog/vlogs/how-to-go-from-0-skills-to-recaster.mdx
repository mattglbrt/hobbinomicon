## One Month of Recording!

For me, this marks one month of recording videos. Gone by so fast.

Today we're doing something I've been putting off for years. Bought this Toad 3-4 years ago with big dreams of using it to start a YouTube channel. Never got around to it.

Also got two demon princes. Casting all of this without a single clue what we're doing.

## The Wax Trick

How to attach the toad to the bottom of the cup? Hot glue might melt the plastic. Couldn't find it anyway.

Solution: Scoop wax from a candle, hit it on there quick, swoop it into the cup. First try, baby!

## Smooth-On Moldstar 15 Slow

Eyeballing the height—the toad needs about 150ml of silicone. Made 300ml total.

**Key lesson**: Don't pour one cup into another. The silicone clinging to the cup throws off your ratio. Dump both into a third cup.

Pour slowly and from high up. Don't use an oscillating fan—it blows air bubbles into your stream.

## The Hexagon Rock Experiment

Made a mold of a random rock I like. Thinking it'll make cool basalt hexagon terrain. All is not lost with experiments!

## 8 Hours Later - The Demold

There's got to be a better way to get the cup off. But the wax trick worked—popped the frog right out.

## First Cast: Smooth Cast 305

Holy dang. Lost some feet—air bubbles formed where air couldn't escape. Need to poke vent holes in the mold.

**The result**: Awesome for first try! Only the feet are messed up. A couple air bubbles on warts (looks intentional on a Chaos model). Once I get a vacuum chamber, this will be even better.

## The Future

This is going to be the future of the hobby for me. If you haven't tried casting—do it. I half-assed most of this and still got great results.

Now I need to learn to sculpt! Going to sell these toads for whatever they sell for once I refine the system. Just want more people to have them.

30 days of daily videos is crazy!
