## Day 120

Hobby vlog day 120. This has been the most challenging day since I started the channel—the most challenging day personally in my life with everything going on.

And I'm doing it. I'm painting. I'm putting paint on the model.

For most of today, I thought this was going to be the day the streak ended. I didn't think I was going to get a video out.

## Five Minutes Is Enough

I'm taking maybe five minutes to put paint on the model. This last little bit that needs Broad Sword Silver—I'm doing it. I'm getting paint on the model. I'm making the video.

This quick little video is going to be a reminder: if I can do it today, I can do it tomorrow.

And the same goes for you.

## The Message

If you can make it through today, you can make it through tomorrow.

Sometimes just a little five-minute thing you've got to do to call the day a success, to get through it and get on to tomorrow—that's what you have to do. And that makes it a good day.

I hope you have a good day. See you tomorrow.
