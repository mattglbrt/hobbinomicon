## The Breakthrough

All the robes are done and now I'm switching to the normal clothes guys. These will go super fast—I've already done 10 of them in 15 minutes.

## The Secret: Synthetic Brushes

Shout out to Jay for letting me know you're supposed to use a synthetic brush with speed paints. I didn't know that!

I was using a sable brush and the paint was wicking up into the ferrule immediately. The synthetic brush with a pretty long well doesn't wick up and doesn't dry as quickly.

Now I'm zooming! Just give it a quick rinse every three models and it comes right off into the water pot.

## So Maybe Contrast Paints Don't Suck

I was blaming the paints, but it was a me thing. These are Speed Paints 2.0, so it wasn't that either.

Going to get all these done in the morning and might be able to get close to done today. Then two days to paint an actual orc for Orctober.

I've kind of abandoned getting this army done in October, but now I'm thinking about the rest of the year.
