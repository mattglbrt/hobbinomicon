## Transcript

All the robes are done and now I'm just switching to the guys in normal clothes. So there's still like—I'm still going to paint it black still. But these will go super fast. Like I've already done 10 of them in like 15 minutes. So it's super fast.

Also the other thing that's making it faster, I switched to a synthetic brush. Shout out to Jay for letting me know you're supposed to use a synthetic brush with speed paints. I didn't know that. I was using a sable brush, but the synthetic brush—it's not wicking. Also, I got one with a pretty long well on it and it doesn't wick up into the ferrule and it doesn't dry as quickly.

So, I'm zooming now. Like I just give it a quick rinse off like every three models and it comes right off into the water pot and now I'm zooming. So, I wish I knew that before. Definitely a me thing.

So, maybe contrast paints don't suck. Like I guess technically these are speed paints. Oh, and they are 2.0. That was the other question. They are definitely 2.0. So it's not that either, but zooming now.

So I think I'll get all these done in the morning and then we'll see. Might be able to get close to done today. Probably get very close to done today. Go to client offices tomorrow and then finish them on Wednesday. And then I've got two days to paint an actual orc for Orctober. I've kind of abandoned getting this army done in October, but now I'm thinking about the rest of the year and what that's going to look like.
