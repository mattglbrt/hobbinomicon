## Transcript

All right. It's 9:00 a.m. with some morning coffee. I finished that top buckle same way as the bottom one. I didn't want to just keep making the same video over again. So, pretty crazy. It's going to get pretty crazy.

I know your boy's not going to miss a video upload. Definitely. I got to—it's crazy. Like had that magnifier mess my forehead up, but it grows like crazy on the sides and the bottom, but it don't grow on the top. And like maybe this will simulate tabletop effect—like, I don't know, I could paint that good.

Today is going to try the second run on the 3D printer. So I think I just got—I had a little tiny bit of resin left. So going to see if I can print a few more nuns for the Trench Pilgrims. And I think that's probably all the resin I have. And then probably after things settle down from the holidays, I will order—I'm gonna—I like to do bulk order resin just because it saves money on it.

My plan is to print—I have Trench Pilgrims mostly done. Going to finish Trench Pilgrims. Going to print Iron Sultanate, Heretics. I already printed most of Courts. Those are the ones I'm really interested in actually playing. Mostly the bad guys.

And then there's New Antioch. I really just don't like a lot of those models. I like the machine armor dudes. So, I'm going to use some of them in my Heretics and heretic them up with the paint job probably, because I just like the sculpts a lot. Some of the Red Brigade stuff especially. So, going to use that in my Heretics. So, I probably won't print too much of those guys. Probably pass on that army. And also, I just—I don't like being good guys.

And actually, I'm definitely going to revisit the belt. I'm trying to see. Let me put it back on the table. All right. So, looking at the belt, I think I want to just come in and establish the shadows some more. I'm happy with the top highlight, and I'm happy with the texture. And the texture is so—the brush strokes are just so fine that it's hard to come through on camera. Actually, I guess that top strap, you can see it. But really, I just want to come back in and establish more shadows. So, I'll probably do that, but I don't know if I'll do it today. But it's coming along great.

3D printer is definitely fixed.

So, I did go back in and just add a little bit more purple in the shadows, and I'm trying to get the best lighting on it as I can, but this is where we're at now. And I think it looks really good. So, if you're in America, happy Thanksgiving. Because you're probably watching this tomorrow and I'll see you.
