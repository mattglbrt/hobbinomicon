## Transcript

Working on the robes today, finishing up all the cloth.

### Painting the Robes

I just did this in Fantasmic Bolt for the base coat. I actually did like two layers to build it up over the black. Now I'm just coming back in with our white mixed in with it. Doing the same thing we did with the purple robe of using the dotting method to get these chunky highlights in so we keep that high amount of contrast.

### The Wrong Way to Paint Yellow

Next, moving on to Maze Yellow. Just doing a triad color scheme here. This took like two or three coats because this is exactly how you shouldn't paint yellow. But it is what it is and I wanted this effect. I wanted that yellow to look kind of dirty and beat up. But this is definitely not the way to paint yellow if you want a good nice vibrant yellow.

I also put a little bit on the pipe to kind of lighten up the wood there by the mouth. And I put some on the book but I'm just kind of playing around on the book. I'm going to do something totally different on that.

The big thing here with the yellow again: this is not how you normally want to paint yellow, but I wanted it to be dirty and grungy. So I really just want to emphasize that. Don't try to put yellow over black.

### Building Up the Highlights

Never paint yellow over black. You know, I knew it was going to turn out like this. If you want a good yellow, don't do it over black. But I wanted that yellow to be kind of dirty, like he'd been walking through the forest.

Then again, same thing as every other color. I just mixed in that warm vanilla white. Some of it's kind of thick on the bottom, but again, we're trying to speed paint and just do this dotting highlighted style. It looks pretty good.

Remember the goal is like from far away, you get the high contrast between the shadows and the highlights. So at the tabletop role playing level, it looks really good. And almost intentionally, it looks not good close up. But we're aiming for this because honestly this might just be I might be like live streaming a tabletop instead of using tabletop simulator. Maybe I just have all these actual models and play it that way. I don't know. I'm working it out through my head.

### What's Left

Now we just have the head and the glasses, the hand. I did the hooves. You probably can't really see too well. And I did the horn too. But the book, which I've just been jamming out on, I'm going to actually paint that. It's not going to be yellow. The smoke and the face. Oh, and the non-metal metallic. We're going to do a non-metal metallic on the little trinkets. But that might be all we're going to do on him today.

## Surprise Warmachine Patch Notes!

So after I started recording stuff, SFG dropped the full Warmachine patch update today, like a week early, so we can actually look at it.

### Gareth and Fifth Division

Looks like I was right about Gareth and Fifth Division. They just kind of did find and replace to lower their RAT down one, but they didn't actually change the ranges on any of the things that mattered.

For Gareth, the Mage Hunter Strike Force got nerfed pretty bad by losing Dual Attack, and then the other one lost Gang, which we kind of expected, but their power went up by two. So I think those two factions are going to be pretty nasty going into next season.

### Deeper Dive

I double checked a couple things. The Jacks did get their RAT lowered, but that doesn't really matter because they're going to have the focus to boost a hit anyway.

Fifth Division didn't get touched at all where it matters. Their MAT got lowered, but the Jacks who were playing were at eight, so they're at seven now. They're still going to hit. The infantry's RAT didn't get touched. So the infantry is staying where it is. They lose Inspiration, so I guess technically they take the hit that way, but they're still pretty good.

After this initial read, the Gareth list, no way. They nerfed the Arcane Age Generator so he doesn't give out plus two to everybody. All the infantry got nerfed. He got hit pretty hard. So I think I'm not even gonna try, especially because it's all not painted. So he's gonna stay in the box forever probably.

### My Plans Going Forward

Now it's a toss up between Fifth Division and Crucible Guard. Definitely still going to paint both. My Fifth Division's almost done. But I think I'm going to lean towards Fifth Division. I had a lot of fun playing it. But I still love Crucible Guard too. I love how both factions look. Love painting the Crucible Guard.

I probably need to get some table time to make an assessment for the rest of the year, but it's going to be one of those.

### Menoth and Temple Guard

I just finished going through all the changes in depth and one thing I noticed is that Thyra kept Carnage and Silence of Death. So I don't know if that's enough to save Menoth, especially Temple Guard, but I'm going to try it.

### Standard Bearers Are Useless Now?

I find it interesting that they pretty much made all the standard bearers useless. They don't actually do anything in most of the factions now. They did lower it a point, so you're paying one point for two bodies.

I think with Temple Guard specifically, it's pretty cool. You get an extra shield guard. But I think a lot of the UAs now, you're paying for a body that's just there. A lot of them don't even have weapons like the other people do. I don't know what they were thinking there. They should have at least done something useful.

### Is This the Last Year for Legacy?

To me, and this is pure conjecture, that really puts the writing on the wall that maybe this is the last year that Legacy is going to be in Mark V because they just made half the UAs literally useless. Which is weird.

They took a big chunk out of Convergence of Crisis. And they took away Mad Caps and Piggybacks and a couple other things from Grymkin, but those are the two big ones.

I'm getting the feeling that if I want to play Legacy, this is probably the year that I should do it. So I think I'm going to try that Thyra list out that I'm working on just to see if that makes a big enough difference with her still having the hit fixing and now everybody's MAT and RAT being lower. Maybe they won't just get blown off the table. My hopes aren't high for that, but I do want to try it.

### Fifth Division Still Strong

The Gun Carriage RAT didn't go down. The RAT's the same. They didn't change any of Stryker's abilities. He can still boost RAT. There's still the Artillery Captain who can increase range and RAT.

There's still a lot of very interesting things in Fifth Division even though they still took the MAT and RAT hit. I don't think it's going to affect them as much as other people because what they were doing, they can still do. You can still run mass infantry with Butcher. They still have the Combined Range Attack. They're still going to benefit off Butcher's feat with the extra dice.

I don't think it's going to hit them as hard as everybody else and I'm excited for it. Thanks for watching. See you tomorrow.
