## Monday Morning Cleanup

It's 9:00 a.m. Monday morning. We're going to get all of this cleaned up—hopefully today, probably not, but definitely by this week. This is my main priority now, not the hobby projects.

I think it's better to take a break from actual hobby so I can do the actual hobby, because it's getting crazy in here. Time to be an adult.

## The Corner of Shame

Starting with this corner of shame. There's going to be stuff for eBay, stuff to give away. As a thank you to everybody who stuck with me through the last couple of weeks of junk videos.

## The Organization Plan

- **Black bookshelf**: Books only (they're scattered everywhere right now)
- **White shelf**: Pile of shame—if it fits, that's my limit
- **Plastic trays**: Painted stuff for tabletop RPGs or games I don't need on display

If my collection doesn't fit, more stuff has to go.

## Kinspoke Miniatures Print

While cleaning, I'm running the printer on the Kinspoke Miniatures Patreon models—wing holder for the Fantasm, some trolls, little guys called wubles, and a fairy dragon.

## Setting Limits

Eventually, each shelf will become a diorama display. The pile of shame has to fit on one shelf—that's the limit. Anything unpainted has to fit there.

## Clear Resin Sucks

I decided clear resin sucks. I don't think I'd ever use it again.

## The Toad Giveaway

I've got two toads—they have air bubbles in the foot, so they're not perfect. I'm still figuring out the vacuum pot for perfect casts.

These will come with the recast license so you can cast them yourself if you want. Just leave a comment to enter—I'll announce winners on Friday.

## Not Giving Up

Had some momentary blips in life that made videos hard. Desperately need a trim up. But not giving up.
