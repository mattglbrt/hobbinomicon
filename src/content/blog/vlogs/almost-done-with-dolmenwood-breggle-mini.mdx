## Transcript

We're back. Going to finish up everything on this guy today except the smoke and the actual writing in the book.

### Painting the Skin

I'm coming in with the Bony Matter speed paint. This paint is very translucent, and I've got this on 2x speed, just putting it on the face and the hands. This takes several layers to build up to get to this point. It took me probably like just 20 minutes of glazing it. You probably could have done it faster, but I'm just in the habit of glazing and being very cautious with it.

### Working on the Fur and Hair

Next up is Ruddy Fur speed paint. I did that on the hair. Now I'm just mixing in that ruddy fur with the white like we've done everything else over here on the palette.

### The Book Pages

Before I mix in that ruddy white, I'm going over the yellow of this book with some glazes. I actually got my paint too wet here. I just want to show you how I fixed it. I got it on and I was trying to save it with just the brush, but there was just too much water that I mixed in. So I'm going to grab the big dry brush and just sponge it off. I'm keeping some on there to create that texture.

### Highlights and Details

Now I'm just painting horns. Getting the highlights in on the fur the same way we've highlighted everything else, just those big chunky dots. If you've seen it on the other parts of the video, there really isn't a point of watching it again now. So I'm just gonna skip ahead to the next step.

You can see we pretty much made like a chocolate milk color on our palette, and that's what we highlighted all the fur and the skin with. Now I'm just coming back in with our straight off-white that we've been using to highlight everything else. It's also just a really good kind of aged paper color.

I'm mixing this in with a little bit of water, testing it on my thumb. Now I'm just going to glaze over and build up the highlights of where that book curves because I want to keep all the texture and all of the different degrees of grime in the page there.

### Quick Non-Metallic Metal

Now I'm going to do the simplest NMM you've ever seen. I'm pretty much painting everything but the very brightest points with Snake White Leather, just a light brown, dabbing that in any part that's black pretty much.

Now I'm coming back in with Maze Yellow speed paint after that dried and mixing it together and just kind of jamming out. It just has to give the impression that it's yellow. Not really trying to spend a ton of time and effort on this. It pops enough. I think it's a little too yellow. I'd probably go back and use a different color yellow, but that's what I had on my desk because I think it blends too much like the robe. But quick and easy non-metal metallic.

### Painting the Glasses

Now, Battleship Gray. I mixed in a little bit of Royal Robes at first, but it was actually too much blue. So just the Battleship Gray. We're going to use this to paint the actual glass of the lenses.

I've painted the black around the top of them. I'm just going to hit this white part here on both sides, being careful. Some of it does end up getting onto the skin, which is just a quick fix.

Now see here, I'm just putting in two dots of white as a reflection. It's not perfect. Again, my goal here wasn't to win any awards.

### The Eyes

Now I have just pure straight white and I'm using the curl of my brush to just dab a touch into the eyes. We want to kind of give the effect like goat's eyes are pretty creepy if you've ever looked up close to them. I'm not going to get up in there and actually paint the pupil like that. I'm putting this dot in because this is going to kind of give the illusion, and you see it here from far away, that his eyes are kind of glinting at you because we're really focused on making this look good, making it pop from the tabletop.

So you can see that white dot on the eyes is just over top of the glasses and the glare and reflection on the glasses points you right into those dots on the eyes. The effect at the tabletop level really makes it look like he's kind of staring you down.

### Final Wash

Now the last bit is Strong Tone. This is an older wash from before speed paints came out, but I'm pretty sure they still make it. It's a quick shade wash. I'm just going to build it up in the shadows of the book to correct where the almost coffee staining from being too white collected in the crack when the paint was thinned down.

This is just going to unite all the different textures, add a really cool brownish aged effect without it actually being too brown. It's a very transparent wash. Very cool.

### Wrapping Up

Now I think we're done for the day. Let's see how he looks.

All right, we finished up everything except the book and the smoke. The pages are done for the most part. I need to revisit the actual book itself and those pages right there. But the pages are now ready for us to draw in them and add our text.

I'm gonna plan that out. That'll probably be tomorrow's video: the book and the pipe smoke. I want to really make the pipe smoke look cool and magical. I'm going to do it in the same way: deep dark shadows, very chunky bright highlights because we really just want this to look good at the tabletop level from far away. Which I think we're definitely getting. Way chunkier highlights than I would normally do. But again, I think it's pretty sick for a speed paint. It's getting where you want it to be.

Going to fix the glasses now that I see it bled through over on the skin and call it a day. Thanks for watching. I'll see you tomorrow.
