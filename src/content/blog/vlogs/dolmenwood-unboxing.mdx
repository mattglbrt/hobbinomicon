## Transcript

Dolmenwood just got delivered, but this box is tore up. I'm a little bit worried about it. Almost dropped it. It's pretty busted up. It's also wet and it's not raining here. So, I'm going to get it open just because I'm worried that it's been sitting soaked somewhere for a while. And this is the one that has all the limited edition stuff in it. So, I'm going to get it open and then I'll go through it. So, it won't be like a cool unboxing video, but I just got to get it out of this.

Okay, everything's out and safe. Look how well packaged this was. Crazy. The moment's finally here. I've made some mushroom soup to celebrate and commemorate the moment I have been waiting for for two years.

All right, we got cloth players map and cloth referee map, which I should probably put so you can see. I think I can't remember. I think it came with a referee's map, but maybe not the cloth players map originally. I know I had to add one of them.

Cool patch for eventually I'm going to get a battle vest made and I'll definitely show that on the channel. Dice pouch. 3XL t-shirt. What's crazy is when I kickstarted this, this would have been tight on me, a 3XL, and I'm still a big boy, but I'm almost at a 2X. And hopefully by this time next year, I'll be down to at least a 1X.

Oh man, it's so cool. Dolmenwood little dwarf boys. Dwarf gnomies. I don't know what they are. I intentionally haven't spoiled Dolmenwood for myself, which has been very hard. I'm going to—I have big dreams, you know. I'm not even going to talk about what I'm going to do with it. I'm just going to do it. And just know I have big dreams about Dolmenwood for things I've been waiting to do. So, let's move on.

Wow. It's like wax canvas feel. And the canvas—it's not super thick canvas, but it feels very high quality. This is very good embroidery. This is awesome. Probably the string—I'll probably put some like make my own leather catch because this part is cheesy but the bag itself is awesome.

Saw these first. I was worried about readability because as you know I am a high contrast kind of guy. Seeing them in person, they're pretty solid. These feel—this D20 feels like a Dice Baron D20. I don't know if they made them, but I'm just saying quality-wise, that's what it feels like. It is definitely heavier and chunkier than like a base set. Let's see how she rolls.

Oh, the important thing is the mushroom. The mushroom is the 20, not the one. All right, there's the d20. And I love when dice sets come with 3d6.

First 3d6 roll is an 11. I'll take it. This is the lucky one. 11, 7. Woo. An 11, 7. I should write this down. This is going to be the first character. Let me grab any scrap piece of paper.

What do we have? 11, 7, 17. We're just—I'm totally blanking on the character sheet right now, which is embarrassing. These dice are some character makers for sure. There's a 13. Hey, I'll take it. This one is—that's consistently low. One of these I'm getting a six like every time. So there is 14. Hey, this character—oh, there's a six. There we go. We had to get balanced out there.

All right, this D4 is a big D4. Like, it's just as big as the other dice, which is pretty cool. As you know, I don't use these percentiles too often, but these are awesome in the pouch.

The pins, I'm not really too sure what I'll do with these. These are pretty cool, though. I'll say these were the thing I was least interested in. If they were magnetic pins, it'd be cool because I could use them to track where people were on the map, but they're obviously not. So, I don't know. But they do feel nice. They look nice. Very cool. The case is definitely nice.

Patch. I'm going to keep this in here so it stays nice. Pretty straightforward.

Maps. I think I'll wait to open the maps up just because I'm definitely going to need more room than the current setup.

This campaign book, man. Nice open map on the inside. Anything Exalted Funeral does is amazing. High quality. I knew it. I mean, Gavin's also just a genius. Anything from Necrotic Gnome. Anything from Exalted Funeral. I was never worried about actually getting it. Was never worried about the quality of when I got it. Was just very excited to get it and I'm glad it's finally here.

Charts and stuff in the back. Again, I don't want to spoil it because I am going to go through it myself. Oh man, contents wise, I'm sure there's tons of like flip-throughs and stuff. This is more of just kind of quick overview. A maps book. Oh, look at that. Everything about this is so great.

God, I love this art. God, it is so awesome. I can spend so much time just flipping through here.

Players book. Same thing. Love these guys. So cool. So cool.

All right, so those are the normal books and then I'll do the special edition books just so we can kind of compare them because I actually don't know if they have different covers or if it's just a slip case that's fancy, you know.

Oh, this is awesome. It's like that leatherette. Oh, they are different or kind of different. Okay, so there's normal monster book. Oh, am I crazy or did I not have a normal monster book? Oh, here it is. Okay. So, it's the same art, which I kind of like because the special editions should be special, but also shouldn't make people with the normal copy feel bad. So, I like how it has—this is embossed. Very nice.

And the text on here has that finish on it. So, it's different. Probably can see it. This feels great. I'm fairly certain the inside is totally the same. That would make sense. Back cover. Very cool. Comparison of back cover printed in Lithuania.

Campaign book. Campaign book art. Same thing. So, I don't think—I mean I'll do the comparison, but it's a little bit shinier. What I really like is the goat.

These will be like my look on my bookshelf and make me happy books. And then these will be the ones that I probably go hard in. The ones that I bring upstairs to actually read through on the couch and not scared to have around my children.

Very cool.

And also the most important thing—there are bookmarks in all these. That is one thing that I'm always constantly looking at and double checking.

One, I have a straight line straight down my binding that I just realized on the campaign book. I don't know if it comes through. It's very faint. Like, it's very nitpicky. I don't know what that's from, but that's okay. This one doesn't have it, so I'm guessing it probably just got scratched, but that's okay. It's not that huge a deal. Now, I say that and I'm just going to keep looking at it.

All right. So, those are the books. Oh man. I'm gonna read through them. They're thick, too. The campaign book is insane, which I guess is—I think effectively the DM guide.

Let's look at referee screen. I just love this art style. I mean, there's different art styles throughout the book, but I just really love how this looks.

So I do my rolls in public. Just because like some things—if something's not important and I just need to know certain things or if it's stuff that the players don't necessarily need to know about, I'll roll it where the players can't see it. But any attack rolls or anything like that, I roll in public. Just because it's more fun that way.

This is cool. I guess I should lay out the full art so you can see the backside. Very cool.

So, I'll set this here. Adventure books. These are like the same size as Necrotic Gnome ones. Oh, wow. Interesting.

So, these—let me go check. I got to go check. Okay. To my knowledge, I have every OSE adventure book. And I just got the one that came out on Black Friday, too. Are these the same size? Okay. Yeah, they're the same size. For a second, I thought it might be taller.

So, I don't understand the number convention because like—I mean their print runs. 20, 21, 22, 23, missing 24. What's 24? Because now that I know these all go together. What is 24 and 25? Because there's 26, 27, and 28 is Dolmenwood, and then 29 and 30 are adventure anthologies.

What is 24 and 25? I don't know, let me know in the comments below. What's Necrotic Gnome 24, 25 and what goes from 02 to 20? Oh, wait. Maybe I do know. We're going to waste a little bit of time. That's what it is. 20. This is 24. This is 25. So, I'm not crazy.

I don't know why that would have bothered me so much, but as far as I know and book format, I don't have the combined books because I just like the little guys. As far as I know, I've got everything. But also, what takes us from 001, 12 to 20? Did they start at 20? Is it the magazines? What's their SKU below 20? I'm done being silly.

Maps at the front. If you don't know, these adventures are just so awesome. They make them just so easy to run and reference. Boom.

Okay, the miniatures. Again, I'm actually not too interested in the miniatures. I don't typically like miniatures of this style. So, my hopes—oh, the box. My hopes aren't too high on them.

So, I'm going to get this open and then I'll get them on the turntable because I finally got it together. I'll get them on the turntable so you can get some closeup views of them.

But really, let's see how they feel. So, these—usually anytime something is molded to the base, I don't like it. But this is—it's not flimsy plastic. Like, I'm going pretty hard on that and it's not bending. It's not—it's a little soft on the arms. Mold line's not too bad. Like, I'll be—and I usually just hate pre-assembled, but this is not too bad.

Cool, actually. Yeah. Like it's just a little tiny mold on her. The scale seems kind of small or at least smaller than what I was expecting it to be because like that's at least—maybe I mean again I just—just because I haven't spoiled it but I thought that these would be bigger than humans.

Like so like I said I won't make you look at all of them now but I'll pull out some ones that I do love. This guy's awesome. I definitely got to use him with his little mushroom shield. This dude is sick.

I feel like this guy should be—or this looks like—yeah, this guy should be bigger because this is supposed to be a beast man. A goat person. A goat individual. And then in terms of—I mean, yeah, he's hunched over, but he's just as tall as a Grimalkin, which is a cat. I don't know. This guy's got heavy Reaper vibes. Like that one.

I think this one could be my favorite except for the mushroom. I'm not sure. You guys are definitely my favorite, but I love how her dog's there. That arrow is not terribly straight, but very cool. Actually, I said I wasn't too excited about these, but some of these I actually am pretty excited about. So, I'll get these on the turntable so you can see them. And that just leaves the maps.

So, let's take a look at them. I kind of want to keep these in the bags. Oh, cool. They're ziplock bags.

So, I'll just—which one is this one? This is referee's map. Oh, I'm going to spoil some locations. And I'm not going to rip the whole—I'm not going to pull the whole mat out. I'm just trying to give you an idea of the quality of it because I think all of this you can go purchase on Exalted Funeral.

Oh, it's like felt feeling. It feels very good. It feels just like the Dragonbane cloth mat. So, it's good. I think thickness-wise it's probably not too thick. Yeah, like that. That's not folded over. That's the thickness of it. But it is stitched on the side, which is awesome. That's the important part for mats like these. So, that'll keep it from fraying.

I like how big these hexes are because you can actually fit a couple different party—like you can actually fit figures on it, you know. Not very many. Actually, how many can we put on here if everybody's on the map? To make everybody—you could fit a party of four without too much struggle.

Pretty cool. But I usually use symbols for the whole party. But anyway, that's cool. I just—I've just been looking at this. I love this art on the players map right here.

So awesome. All right, I'm going to get these figures on the turntable. So, give you some close-ups, and then I think that'll round us out. There's going to be some Dolmenwood content coming for sure as soon as I figure out a few things. So, I don't want to talk about it. I want to be about it. So, just wait. You got to stay tuned for that.
