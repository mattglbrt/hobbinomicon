## Accepting the Solo Gaming Life

I've gone through all the stages of grief and I'm in acceptance - I'm probably not playing outside the house or competitive stuff for a very long time. I'm giving up on trying every weekend and getting frustrated when it doesn't happen.

For the Warmachine locals - just know I planned on coming out almost every weekend for the last two years. Look at how many times I actually made it.

## Starting the Lego D&D Project

So why am I buying Lego minifigures? I'm going to start developing my own tabletop RPG game. As eye-roll as it is because everybody does it.

I'm not making "my own game" - I'm really just going to boil D&D down into core concepts my four and six-year-old can play. We're going to use Legos to do it and share that journey.

Got a great deal on Ninjago Possession Ghosts with weapons - all of these for like 20 bucks. If you don't know about Lego, these could have been a lot of money individually.

## International Lego Day Haul

Took the kids to Bricks and Mini Figs. Got four spiders, four rats, a big spider (Harry Potter set I think), and some extras like a snake. Perfect beginner D&D encounter - rats and spiders for 10 bucks total.

Way cheaper than miniatures. Way cheaper than new Lego.

## KDM Episode 6: Best Hunt Yet

The hunt phase was incredible:
- Sophia triggered the Bold event, gaining understanding and the Prepared ability
- Got two lion claws during the hunt (finally!)
- Drew Destiny Bound giving us ambush

### The Showdown

Because we ambush, we set up wherever we want. Ground fighting is on, so we need to shoot first.

**Key plays:**
- Death Mask archer crits immediately, knocking the lion down
- Sophia lands fist and tooth wounds for weapon proficiency XP
- Clinestra continues being a crit machine with the scrap sword
- The persistent injury makes him roll to skip turns

**The kill:** Clinestra finishes it with a natural 10 on the wound roll. The monster dies at the end of its turn from a persistent injury.

### Resource Jackpot

Perfect pulls - exactly what I needed to build:
- White fur for the lion skin cloak (Sophia can pounce with bone club now)
- Lion claws for weapons
- Perfect organ

Our support guy almost died from a trap but survived with two bleeding tokens. Everyone else came through clean.

Next up: the Screaming Antelope. Time to build that model and some new survivors.
