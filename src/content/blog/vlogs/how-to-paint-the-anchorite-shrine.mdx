## Finishing Trench Crusade

We're finishing up our Trench Crusade warband with an Anchorite Shrine.

## Purple Preshade for Silver

Coming in with a purple dry brush in all the shadows. This adds depth primarily to the wheel and the silver we're putting on.

The silver speed paint we used on other models has purple in the base. This ties the shrine into the other models even though we're using a different silver. I didn't use speed paint silver here because there's so much area to cover and I wanted to dry brush it.

Taking this purple pretty far up the model because so much is going to be that brilliant Mithril Silver from War Colors. The purple gives it visual appeal and contrast.

## Lost Footage

I lost my footage of dry brushing the silver on top of this—power went out and the footage corrupted. I just took my time building it up slowly so I didn't see brush strokes.

## White and Gold

Now painting anything I don't want metallic with white primer color. Going over all the wood and anything that's going to be gold.

Spending extra time on the lamb at the front because I want it white in the final product—probably three coats. Then using Half Gold on all the things supposed to be gold or bronze.

You can see how that purple is really coming through on the silver. It's a really good effect.

## Aged Wood Recipe

My favorite recipe: Guilliman Flesh and Plaguebearer Flesh together to make older, aged wood.

Coming in sloppy with this on the wheel. The Guilliman Flesh over the zenithal with purple makes a really cool effect. Not being neat—really slapping stuff on. Going on the ropes, a little bit on the prisoner, just jamming out.

## Blood Angel's Red Hood

This Blood Angel's Red is really our only opportunity to tie this into the rest of the warband.

## The White Sketch Trick

Using white primer to sketch in where highlights will be on the body on the wheel. When the streaking grime hits it, it'll all blend together and create highlights with very low effort.

## Streaking Grime Time

Slathering it on. I'm not going to hit that sheet on the front very hard—most of what you'll see is from wiping it off and rubbing it down.

Using a sprue sponge to take off most of it, then a makeup sponge for blending and getting it from all the highest points.

## The Results

Look at how great the Catherine wheel looks now that the streaking grime is on it.

Here's the whole warband together, looking great. This whole thing including the shrine took about 3 hours. Maybe 3.5-4 hours once we go back and touch up highlights.

## What's Next

Tomorrow I'll do all the bases and come back with metal edge highlighting and rust effects to really make it pop and finish the warband. I've got some quick tricks for the whole warband to really kick it up to the next level.

Also teased: Call to Arms prep—stripping models, different schemes. That's the next project after Trench Crusade.
