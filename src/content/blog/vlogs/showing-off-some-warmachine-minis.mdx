## Transcript

Not sure what I was thinking yesterday. I'd actually only painted like 15 robes. So, I've done almost another 30 today. I'm about to be done with the robes. Those guys in the back are just like t-shirt guys and some skirt guys.

So, getting through here—I haven't really used speed paints before or contrast paints really. And of course you're not going to be able to tell. You can kind of see like the light's catching it. These contrast paints are tearing my brush apart. Like it's wicking up into the ferrule immediately and I'm having to stop and clean my brush like every two models. And the paint dries on the palette. It's just—I can't use a wet palette because it falls apart. I don't think contrast paints are for me.

It looks okay. And I think they'd be great if you were painting like one or two at a time. But I ended up using a dry palette, just like a normal palette, and I'm putting like two drops at a time because if I put any more it just gets wasted. So, I don't know. I'm using Speed Paint Tyrian Navy. Like I said, I like how it looks. It looks great over—because it gets like a gray over our underpainting. So, it looks great, but it's like just like—I'm pretty sure by the time I get done with this, this brush is going to be trash. Like, I'm trying to clean it. I got water. I don't know.

So if there's a tip to using contrast paints and not hanging up your brush—even if I only try to get the top of the brush with enough paint on it, it wicks back up into it and it just turns into like a gummy mess. So, I don't know what's going on there, but just chugging through. I only have 14 more in robes or the helmet heads, like the cloth helmets, because I kit bashed. A couple of them have like the skirt part bottoms. So I'll definitely do those, but I'm in the final stretch of being done with the black. The robes are taking me a little bit longer, but the other goblins just have those shirts. So I'm still going to use the same black on them and that'll be way faster because I don't have the hoods.

So, the other thing I'm working on is my list for Warmachine this weekend. It's going to be a 30-point team narrative event. I wasn't sure what I was going to play. I was thinking about playing a different army, but I think just because this is already painted and I've got so much on my plate that this is what I'm going with.

So, this is a crazy story. This is my Warcaster. If you know anything about Warmachine—Cyrenia. This is 30 points, which is like an introductory game. So, Menoth is so cheap because they're also like probably not considered to be the best right now. But I think this will be a really great list. It's kind of crazy what I could fit in 30 points. I got a lot of bodies. It's going to be a lot of fun.

These guys I actually picked up super cheap. I painted Cyrenia—I'm probably saying that wrong—and I painted that Vassal. But the rest of these, Frontline Gaming's commission studio painted these. And I got almost the whole faction. There were a couple things that were missing that I've had to go back and paint. They were painted to their tabletop level and then I've gone back in and done edge highlighting on stuff. But in terms of Frontline Gaming's paint job, this is their tabletop plus standard. I believe I've just gone back in and painted highlights on a lot of stuff. Pretty amazing paint jobs all the way around.

So this is a thumbs up to Frontline Gaming. I bought them from—commissioned them—and I got like a steal on these things. Like it's pretty crazy how cheap I got them. I think I paid like $550 and I got the entire faction. So like I don't know.

This guy I put a lot more work into though. Second one back here—that one I got was like black so I had to strip it and then I'm working on painting it to match this one. I'm getting pretty close. Harbinger conversion, real Harbinger that I'm working on. All of these cool guys. There's been a couple holes in it that I've had to fill and match the paint, but I've really enjoyed it.

But this is one half of the faction. I have the whole other half in a box packed up right now. So this is just one half of the faction. I have the whole second half that's boxed up because I'm just not going to play them anytime soon. So, crazy deal. Crazy awesome paint job. It's been fun matching it. A lot of rare figures in here too.

I really like painting this. If you guys like Warmachine figures, here's some Dusk Operations that I'm in the middle of painting, like everything else in my life. More Dusk Operations. Some Khymaera. There's Orgoth down there. Part of my Orgoth list. Maybe one day I'll finish that. Old Khador, which I love. Almost got that faction done as far as I'm going to collect it. Thousand Sons that maybe someday I'll paint. Oh, and these guys which are awesome that I'm working on painting. And of course, old Magnus and Carver hanging out.

Back to these guys. Really excited to play them. It's a ton of fun playing Menoth. They're probably the faction I've played the most since coming back. I've been faction hopping a lot trying to find the faction I like and I couldn't really decide if I like them. I love the models, which is why I bought them originally just to have them in the collection, but now I'm excited to get these guys on the table. I've never played with—I played with Incinerators before, but I haven't played with anybody else here.

So, distraction walking around. I'm going to get back to it and knock out the rest of this. Time to go get some sleep. And I'm telling myself that the next video is going to be the big grand reveal of all the goblins tomorrow. I have the skin left. I have the weapons left, the faces, and the bases.

So, I actually—I'll probably wait through all the bases at once, the whole army. So, I probably won't do the bases, but that means faces, any of the brown patches. I'm going to do a little bit of brown on it, skin, and the weapons tomorrow, which is Saturday. Probably do an arts and crafts day with the kids. So, I can also do some arts and crafts because I didn't get anywhere near as much time to paint today as I thought I would. I'll see you then. It'll definitely be a late in the night video, but I'm really hopeful that it's going to be a big 90 goblin regiment reveal.
