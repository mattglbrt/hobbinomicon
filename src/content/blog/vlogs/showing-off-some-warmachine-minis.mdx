## Goblin Progress

Not sure what I was thinking yesterday—I'd actually only painted 15 robes. Done almost another 30 today, about to be done with the robes. Those guys in the back are just t-shirt and skirt guys.

## Contrast Paint Struggles

I haven't really used speed paints or contrast paints before. These are tearing my brush apart—wicking up into the ferrule immediately. Having to stop and clean my brush every two models.

The paint dries on the palette, can't use a wet palette because it falls apart. I'm using a dry palette and putting two drops at a time because any more just gets wasted.

I'm using Speed Paint Tyran Navy. It looks great over our undershade—comes out gray. But by the time I'm done, this brush is going to be trash.

## My Warmachine List

Working on my list for a 30-point team narrative event this weekend. Going with my already-painted Menoth since I have so much on my plate.

At 30 points (introductory game size), Menoth is so cheap I could fit in a crazy amount. Got a lot of bodies—it's going to be fun.

## The Crazy Deal Story

Frontline Gaming's commission studio (the LVO people) painted most of these. I got almost the entire faction for around $550. Their tabletop plus standard, then I went back and did edge highlighting.

There's been a few holes to fill and match the paint, but I've really enjoyed it. Lots of rare figures in here too.

I have the whole other half boxed up because I'm not playing them anytime soon. Crazy deal, crazy awesome paint job.

## Tomorrow's Goal

The next video should be the big grand reveal of all the goblins. I have skin, weapons, faces, and bases left. Probably do an arts and crafts day with the kids so I can paint too.

Really hopeful it's going to be a big 90 Goblin Regiment reveal!
