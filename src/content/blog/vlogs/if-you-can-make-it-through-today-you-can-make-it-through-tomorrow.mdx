## Day 120

This has been the most challenging day since I started the channel. The most challenging day personally in my life with everything going on.

And I'm doing it. I'm painting. I'm putting paint on the model.

## Almost Broke the Streak

For most of today, I thought this was going to be the day the streak ended. I didn't think I was going to get a video out.

I'm taking like five minutes to put paint on the model. This last little bit that needs Broadsword Silver—I'm doing it. I'm getting paint on the model. I'm making the video.

## The Reminder

This quick little video is going to be a reminder that if I can do it today, I can do it tomorrow.

And the same goes for you. If you can make it through today, you can make it through tomorrow.

Sometimes just a little five-minute thing you got to do to call the day a success and get through it and get on to tomorrow is what you have to do. And that makes it a good day.

So I hope you have a good day. See you tomorrow.
