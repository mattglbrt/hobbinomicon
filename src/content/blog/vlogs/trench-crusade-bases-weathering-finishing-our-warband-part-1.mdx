## The Point of Painting

It's to have fun with it, guys. I'm down here talking to myself, making messes. I'm not worried about if this is going to look good.

For me personally, it's very easy to get caught up in "I have to paint like I'm entering this into a contest." Because of that feeling, I just never get anything painted. It doesn't make me a better painter—it makes me not paint at all.

## Time to Get Technical

We're using weathering pigments to really kick these up now that they're tabletop ready. We start with these, then matte coat everything, then come back with glossy effects like blood and viscera.

## Tamiya Weathering Master

Orange rust, gunmetal, and silver. Comes with a little brush (mine's getting beat from use).

It's very fine powder. You brush it on like a dry brush. This gives us the shine back on metals that streaking grime took away. You don't even really see it on the brush, but when you hit the model, it starts shining.

For the shrine, we want to show it's old while everyone else is expendable. The shrine is eternal.

## Nilakh Oxide Disaster

I actually hate nilakh oxide, but I'll show you how to still get good results. It's easy to overdo and lose all your work.

Important: pluck the edges of foam for the uneven part. Don't use the flat side.

### The Mistake

I stripped the gold paint because I did this too quickly after painting. The oxide stripped right through. Our purple is back. That went through a layer of streaking grime and multiple layers of silver.

This is why I don't like this stuff. It kicks my ass every time.

## Fixing It Live

I'm leaving the mistakes in to show you how we fix them.

The parts where we chipped paint off are higher than everything else. We make it look intentional—stippling and quick strokes with Hoplite Gold contrast paint, catching just the tops.

Then dry brush over the top (don't get it in recesses) to take the edge off the oxide. When it dries, the top that rubs against stuff stays shiny.

## The Bases

- Metal: silver
- Wood: Plaguebearer Flesh
- Stone: we'll figure it out

## Brownish Decay - New Favorite Paint

Very interesting paint. It gets like a film as it dries. Could potentially do cool things with it.

Using it like a chipping medium—hitting it wet again, stippling, being savage with our paintbrush. The stone looks sick just from us being savages.

### Wait, What?

Oh no. It's stripping our silver off. Whatever's in that brownish decay went through streaking grime and multiple layers of silver. Very interesting.

Still my new favorite paint. Even though we're not homies anymore.

## The Warcolor Brush Shout-Out

Look at how rough I've been on this Warcolor size two brush. I can still spin it back into a point. Best paintbrush I've ever used. Go buy one. I don't deserve this thing.

## The Philosophy

It's just paint, guys. If we mess it up, we can do it again. No reason to be scared.

I'm trying to silence my inner critic, but there's only so far I can go. He's always there.
