## Transcript

And the whole point of painting that is to have fun with it, guys. So, a lot of this stuff is to taste. All right, I got my bases cut out. I've got my little glass stone here that I'm using on the bases and I'm just painting this brown on them. And it's that brownish decay from one of the YouTube channels that makes their own paint. I don't know. I'm not sure exactly where I got it from. But it's just a brown paint. Slathering it all over this. I'm going to come back in with a little bit of texture right here.

So, here is our finished Trench Pilgrims. And I added the verdigris or the Nihilakh Oxide patina to all the bronze parts on the warband. And I also did this dry brush around the edges of the armor. And I think it makes it look really cool—like they've been out in the field fighting for an extended period of time. So, I'm going to show you exactly what I did. This is what they looked like when we finished recording the other day. So, we're gonna put on the finishing touches.

So first, I'm going to show you the dry brush around the armor. This is a powder, Tamiya Weathering Master in orange rust. And you just want a stubby brush and just come in and just kind of knock it into the armor, around where it's riveted and welded and stuff like that. It takes almost no time at all. And I think the effect is really cool. You just want to hit where rust would form naturally and it ties the whole thing together.

Now, once you're done with that, we've got Nihilakh Oxide. This is a GW technical paint. And you just get a very small amount on your brush. You want to be careful not to get too much because we're really just tracing around all the gold parts. And you can see this adds a really cool patina and verdigris to them. This adds a lot of visual interest to those bronze parts. And it's just really fast and easy to do. And then come back in and clean it up so it's not on any of the other parts. So, a dry brush with some mineral spirits and we can wipe it off the silver.

So that's all I did on the Trench Pilgrims and on this shrine. And what I want you to see is on the shrine itself, I came in and hit all the gold with that Nihilakh Oxide patina and then I traced in the rust with the Tamiya Weathering Master. And you can see the rust is really heavy on the bottom of this shield over here and around the edges. And then the patina is on all the gold parts. And this really makes it look like this thing has been out in the field for a long time. And it just ties the whole warband together.

And that's it for the finishing touches on the Trench Pilgrims. I think the verdigris and the rust weathering really bring the whole warband together and make them look battle-worn and grimy, which is perfect for the Trench Crusade aesthetic. In the next video, we're going to do the bases for these guys. So, stay tuned for that. Thanks for watching.
