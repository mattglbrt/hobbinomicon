## Successful Print Day

That's a full successful print for my Quartz Trench Crusade models!

## The Pixel Art Easter Egg

I've been working on my website and wanted an Easter egg. Of course I thought of the toad—the chaos toad from Miscast. I opened up Aseprite and started vibing out.

I learned this program to make Perler bead sprites many years ago, probably in high school. My only advice is to keep doing it over and over—you get better at it. I start with the outline first, then color in the inside. Once you have the outline, it's a lot easier.

## Crown & Skull Character Creation

This is a tool I built myself—running it locally. It has all the options for custom spell building that aren't in the free kit. I'll try to reach out to Brandon to see if I can share it.

You start with 50 points and build things out. I based my character loosely on Silena—built a custom blizzard spell that's a mix of her abilities and Snow Squall. Also made a custom greatsword.

What I like about Crown & Skull: you can really adapt anything you want into it.

## Building Silena

I started her at 100 points, then bumped to 150 so I could make the two cats as companions instead of separate characters. Normally you'd start at 50 points.

Since I'm playing solo, this won't be cheesy because I'll control it. I want her to be a legend—my plan is to play out this solo campaign, and then these characters become NPCs for when I run campaigns with a full group.

## The Party

- **Vyar**: The repair guy and support. Armorer, medical, can repair skills.
- **Helmet Guy**: Climber, outdoorsman. Helm, cloak, plate mail, rope, climbing gear.
- **Dual Wielder**: Glass cannon with two greatswords. She can take about five real hits and she's out—definitely need to protect her.
- **Silena**: Stealth, evade, take aim, scout. D10 damage bow with upgrades.

## Getting the Airbrush Working

I always wanted one of these cleanout pots—finally got one. Did maintenance to get everything back to pretty much brand new.

The airbrush isn't 100%—there's something in the internals. Maybe there's a way to take it apart from the bottom. But we're primed! That's all we needed.

## The Turning Point

Tomorrow for real is day one of the new painting journey to get as good as possible. I've got a lot of thoughts on this—it's a big turning point, like starting the next chapter of my life. As ridiculous as that sounds, it's a lot deeper than just deciding I want to paint better.
