## Quick One Tonight

I wanted to get this Circle Orboros army primed tonight and get a zenithal on it. And tonight is the night my airbrush decided to die.

It's been about a 2-week process of trying to get it working again. It's almost 11 or 12 years old. I think it's just reached its limit.

## The Hack

I was going to give up, but then I realized I wouldn't be able to get any hobbying done or get a video out today. And I had this cool new setup finally.

I couldn't get the airbrush to work, but I had to figure out a way to get this army primed. I can't rattle can right now.

So I pulled the needle out of the airbrush, backed it all the way out so there's no action on the brush. As soon as I press the button, it's blasting paint.

That's how I got it done. Pulled that needle out and started blasting.

## The Results

I was able to get everything primed black. It looks pretty good. By the very last figure, the airbrush had totally given up—probably clogged from what I was doing to it.

So I just put it down, got a brush, and brush primered the very last model.

## What's Next

Now we are ready to go into tomorrow. I'll probably rattle can a zenithal on it.

The challenging part is going to be brush painting this entire army without my airbrush, because that was going to be a key part of my workflow. Usually with army painting I rely heavily on the airbrush to get things done and get good results.

This is really going to force me out of the box. Going to have to knock the dust off the brush skills.

## Livestream Announcement

The big cool part: Wednesday, 1:00 PM Eastern time, I plan on doing my first actual livestream. I think it'll be more fun with the way I like to ramble and talk out loud while painting.

Here we go.
