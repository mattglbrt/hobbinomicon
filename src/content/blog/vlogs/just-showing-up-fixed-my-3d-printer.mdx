## Found in the Bits Box

Digging through the bits box finishing up conversion stuff for the goblins. Found this guy—old vampire lord, maybe fourth edition or second Fantasy.

It's really making me want to do Mordheim. I'm trying to talk myself out of project hopping. I'm 20 hours into these goblins and now is the time to paint them. And I'm thinking about another project—that's too real for me.

I'm setting them aside. The next thing after goblins is going to be Mordheim everything.

## Almost Broke the Streak

Day 37 or 38. This is the first day I thought I might not get a video done in time. Lot of stuff during the day. One of the kids got sick, which means all the kids are going to get sick. The plague is going to spread. I think I'm probably getting it too.

But not going to break my streak.

## Fixing the Printer

I was tinkering with my 3D printer, which hasn't been working. I think I fixed it. Going to try printing some wings for the Ice King.

The print bed was trying to push itself—there was no zero on the Y-axis. It just kept trying to go down, never actually homed.

## The Fix

What I did:
1. Cleaned the whole printer top to bottom with isopropyl alcohol
2. Scrubbed it all out, got everything as clean as possible
3. Went to the website and flashed new firmware/drivers
4. Pretty much wiped the printer and started over

Now it's working. I wish I would have done that weeks ago, months ago at this point.

## Kingsfoot Miniatures

Also discovered Kingsfoot Miniatures. He's a sculptor who makes awesome characterful models. I signed up for his Patreon—this month is a woodland troll.

I'm printing in transparent resin. Don't want to max out the build plate just in case it fails, so I'm going small.

## Pretty Big Win

Pretty big win to be printing again, especially now that I want to start getting into designing my own stuff and casting models.

Tomorrow I'll definitely have time to prime the goblins and actually start painting them. That just wasn't in the cards for today.
