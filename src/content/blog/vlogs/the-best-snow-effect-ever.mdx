## Safety First

I have gloves on. I have a respirator on. I'm doing this voiceover after the fact because this crushed glass is no joke. You don't want to inhale it. You don't want it on your skin.

I'm working in a metal tray that I can dump out. I'm using an old Chessex dice case as a wet palette and a very old dirty busted brush. I'm going to throw all this stuff out when I'm done. I've made the mistake of getting this in my skin before and it is absolutely miserable.

## The Materials

- Crushed glass from Secret Weapon (many brands make it now)
- Realistic Water (or gloss medium, or Woodland Scenics water)
- Fishing line for icicles

Don't shake the realistic water—it just introduces air bubbles.

## Creating Icicles

I'm gluing fishing line at different spots down the roof to make icicles—or really, a slurry mix of snow melting off the roof.

Narratively, this was an abandoned shed that they've turned into the Love Shack. So that ice is melting off because the heat is turning on.

I'm picking where the snow would be running off the most—out of the rivets and the slats between wood panels.

If you wanted actual icicles, you can use fishing line and drip realistic water very carefully down through the line. Some will fall off, so collect it, but you can slowly build up real icicles that way.

## The Snow Slurry

A couple drops of realistic water in with the crushed glass. The more water you add, the more of a melted slurry ice look you get. This doesn't really change when it dries—what you see when you put it on is what you'll get.

I'm working this down those icicles and into the cracks, following mentally where I think the snow would go. I'm not being scientific—just doing what looks nice and makes the most dynamic model.

I'm building up where it overhangs, tracking a little down the side of the building, and putting some where it catches on the ridges of the metal plates toward the ground.

## The Narrative Details

It's going to melt around the metal first. I'm imagining the heat is getting turned on, so this boiler is starting to heat up and the snow is starting to melt. The side facing the heat has more melting, while the other side is still catching up.

I did an extra soupy area and tried to make footprints going into the door. Piled it up around the edges.

## The Result

Here's the finished piece. It turned out so good! This stuff looks like real powdery snow. The way the glass catches the light and glints—on this roof, it actually looks like there's wet water dripping off.

## Why Crushed Glass Wins

I've tried a bunch of different snow products—baking soda, paint effects—and nothing is ever as good as crushed glass. It's kind of a pain to work with, but once you get it down, there's really nothing that compares.
