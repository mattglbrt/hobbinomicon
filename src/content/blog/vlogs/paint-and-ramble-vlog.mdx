## Squeezing in Paint Time

This turned into one of those days where I thought I was going to get a lot of paint time in, and instead I'm trying to slam in a little bit before bed. This is where we left off with the Crucible Guard jacks—if you want to see how we got here, watch yesterday's video.

## Experimenting with Speed Paints

Now we're going to cut in the black. I think I'm going to stick to these Army Painter speed paints. I haven't used a lot of them, so I'm still learning how they work. The traditional slap chop method is great, but I don't really like it for my style of painting. I use them more as premixed glazes.

We're going to cut in this black and try to stick to using Army Painter paints as much as we can until it's time to do the final highlight—then I'll probably switch over to some acrylics.

## Being Careful with the Airbrush Work

Just being careful. I definitely don't want any paint to get on our airbrush work. I don't know why, but something about the speed paints just makes me slow down. I realized that when I was painting the Butcher.

I'm being super careful because we're coming up against that airbrush work. This will probably take more than one coat to go over. I probably shouldn't be using speed paint to go over this—a normal black would have done it in one coat. But I'm using this as an opportunity to experiment with these speed paints.

## Rambling About Life

My air compressor just kicked on—forgot to turn it off. It's crazy, I still don't have my voice fully back yet. This is the worst I've ever been sick. Two steps forward, one step back. The fever and stuff is finally gone, and I'm not coughing so bad, but this has just been brutal.

Luckily all the kids are good. My wife and I got it worse than everybody else. But I guess if it had to be someone, I'm glad it was me.

## The Worst Part About Having Kids

That's really the worst part about having kids—one, you get sick because they're just sickness magnets, especially my son who puts his mouth on everything. They get sick first, and I'm still recovering from all the damage I did to myself in my 20s. So they bounce back a whole lot faster.

By the time they're super healthy, I'm usually the most sick I'm going to be. So it's even worse because you're still just trying to chase them around.

## The Black Makes a Difference

You can already see that's making a big difference. The black cut in between the airbrush work is really making the airbrush work look good. Even the stuff that's going to be gold, I'm going to hit with a silver first. It'll make our golds brighter and make up for having to do the gold over the airbrush work.

## Showing Up Matters

This one is really just about showing up. These last two weeks have been crazy because I've got a lot of cool stuff I've been recording, but I haven't finished any of it yet because I was out of commission dying from being sick.

It's wild—I did that whole Ultimate Dungeon terrain board while I had such a high fever I was hallucinating while painting. I'm looking at it behind me and I don't even really have a memory of doing it. It really shows what's possible when you show up.

## The Temptation to Skip Highlights

When you come in with this airbrush stuff, it's really tempting to just call that done because we did some cool airbrushing effects. I didn't even think about light—I just put the shadows where I wanted them to go, kind of played it by ear.

Once we base coat everything, you're going to be really tempted to just say screw it and leave the airbrush work without edge highlights. But if we come in and edge highlight, hit the tops of those little bumpy things, it's really going to do wonders for the paint job. And it's not going to be that hard to do.

## Goblin Skin Struggles

My problem with the goblins is I painted and finished a couple, but I don't like the skin. I've been playing with a bunch of different greens and can't get the skin I like. Some of them I've stripped down and repainted just trying to figure it out.

I didn't like the super bright skin tone at first, but now it's kind of growing on me. I think maybe I will do a super bright crazy green skin tone on them and just get them done.

## Wrapping Up

It's pretty late, I'm pretty sleepy. I think that's all I can do right now. We just got to paint a bunch of metal—I'm joking. Probably got a couple hours left on this guy. Still looking forward to not being sick anymore and just trying to get as much progress as I can.

Almost happy New Year time—see you tomorrow!
