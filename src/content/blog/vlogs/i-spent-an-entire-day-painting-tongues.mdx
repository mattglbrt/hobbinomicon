## A Day of Tongues

Spent the entire day painting squig tongues. Was watching White Star Minis and just started jamming out—almost forgot to record this.

## The Highlight Process

Coming back in with straight Squid Pink—not really thinned down, just a touch of water. Adding that final highlight.

I could keep adding bright highlights, glazing over to blend, adding fine highlights, glazing again... but there's got to be a point where we move on.

## Progress Made

- Painted the little feet
- Painted the spots that will be black
- Started cutting in details

## Next Steps

Going to base coat all the details off camera. Those chains are going to be terrible, and cutting in the goblins will be hard from a logistics angle with the camera.

Using Monolith Primer Black on the toes—going to paint everything black first. When I come back to paint actual colors, I'll record again. Just want to cut in the black so it separates from the skin and all the red without messing up the work we've done.
