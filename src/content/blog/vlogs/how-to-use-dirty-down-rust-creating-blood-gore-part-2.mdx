## Sealing and Rusting

Everybody's been matted down and sealed. Now we're bringing in the Dirty Down Rust, doing a section at a time.

Heat gun time. Man, this stuff smells like it literally smells like crap. Hitting the rest of it just because.

## Reactivation

Just water on the brush. Dab dab dab dab everywhere. Back in the pot. Stippling. Get it a little wet. Reactivate some areas.

Heat gun again.

When we get it wet like this, we're taking the rust off the very tips of the chain links while reactivating everything else. Let the rest dry naturally.

## Silver Highlights

Mithril Silver on the palette. Dry brush. Work it into the bristles.

We want to make sure we have a lot off the brush—using the sponge, really making sure that's off. Now just very lightly on the accumulated areas.

## Blood Time

Blood for the Blood God. And down the legs because he's just been getting clapped. Also, this is going to help cover up all that we didn't paint.

## The UHU Glue Gore

This is where it gets cool. UHU Universal Adhesive. Oh, I squeezed it too hard. This thing is under pressure. That's a problem for another day.

Now Blood Angels contrast on a brush I don't care about. Getting a lot of paint in there.

Now with this disposable brush, see it's already getting there. Take this globule—pop pop—just putting it where I want stringy blood.

## Finger Painting Gore

Finger glove on. Glue on the tip of my glove. Just swiping it on the wheel.

You got to think fast sometimes. We want these thin strands of gunk because we want it to be a little bit over the top, right?

That's disgusting.

And most importantly, it covers up how little we spent on the paint job.

## More Blood for the Blood God

Coming in, going to stick my finger in the pot. Stippling with a glove. This is ridiculous.

I think I took it a little bit too far for my personal taste, but hey, it's Trench Crusade. That's what it's about.

Finger painting gore. Utterly ridiculous. But it works.
