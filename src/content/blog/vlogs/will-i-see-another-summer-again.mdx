## Feeling Rough

At this point, I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever see another summer again. It just keeps getting worse.

I'm just thinking about all the stuff I haven't finished that I still need to finish.

## At Least the Bases Worked

I almost forgot—the bases printed! They're not getting on camera today because I got to clean the supports off. But they worked.

See you tomorrow.
