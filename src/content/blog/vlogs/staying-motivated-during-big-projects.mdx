## Transcript

This has been sitting for a couple of days now. And before I get set up to go full goblin mode, I wanted to pull this out of here. And normally I would do two-part silicone, one part and cut it down. But let me hold it like a normal human being. Yeah, like we're pretty spot on. Here we go. So, obviously there's a ton of flash I need to trim off, but there's no bubbles or anything.

It's hard when you're putting in all this work on a project, especially like a long project and a project that's got a ton of different models in it like this one, and you're not really seeing any results. I'm now, I think, officially I hit the 12 hour mark on this, like especially counting the bases. And I have the night goblins are all ready to be assembled. The regular goblins I am almost done. I just have, I think, the spears left now and the heads. And you can see me working through all of those earlier today.

And I was just kind of getting a little bit discouraged even after sitting down and I think I put in like 4 hours total yesterday and then probably just as much today by the end of it and to just not even have a built goblin. That's the only bad part about doing this method is like it takes a while to actually kind of see the fruits of your labor.

So I just took a pause here in the middle of the goblins and I based all the orcs I had already built a couple days ago and that was just to see like visually see these models ranked up—did a whole lot for my morale and motivation on this project because even though obviously they're not painted or anything, just seeing them ranked up and seeing almost I think at this point 30 orcs staring at me, I just felt great like I was actually making progress on this thing.

So, that's my tip for today is if you're working through these big ones, get a couple of quick wins in throughout the longer parts of it just so you can keep that motivation going because now I'm ready to like hit these goblins again and get them all finished up and prime tomorrow.
