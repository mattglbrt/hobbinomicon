## Checking on a Cast

This has been sitting for a couple days. Normally I'd do two-part silicone, but let me hold it like a normal human being. Pretty spot on—ton of flash to trim but no bubbles.

## The Motivation Problem

It's hard when you're putting in all this work on a long project with tons of different models and you're not seeing any results.

I've officially hit the 12-hour mark on this, especially counting bases. Night goblins are ready to assemble, regular goblins just have spears and heads left.

I put in about 4 hours yesterday, just as much today, and don't even have a built goblin yet. That's the only bad part about this method—it takes a while to see the fruits of your labor.

## My Tip: Get Quick Wins

I took a pause in the middle of the goblins and based all the orcs I'd already built a couple days ago. Just to visually see these models ranked up did a whole lot for my morale.

Even though they're not painted, seeing almost 30 orcs staring at me, I just felt great—like I was actually making progress.

## The Lesson

If you're working through big projects, get a couple quick wins throughout the longer parts. Keep that motivation going.

Now I'm ready to hit these goblins again and get them all finished up to prime tomorrow.
