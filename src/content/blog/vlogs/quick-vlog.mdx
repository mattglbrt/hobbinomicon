## Transcript

The day is here. I came and I'm very excited to paint it and move on to the next main big project I'm going to do. But I've got to clean up this mess. I've got to finish up all these straggler projects. I've got to finish up cleaning. As you can see over my head, we're getting there.

I think finally my life is back on track. I got these little guys all done. They look so cool. And I'll do like a real shot so you can see how they look on the board. But I got these done, turned out great. Obviously, just dirtied down moss again on the bottoms. I'm going to do something for the bottoms, but I don't know what yet—just to protect the board and the blocks from each other.

But today and tomorrow, maybe Saturday, get everything that I almost have done done, and everything I'm not going to do put away so I can kind of clear my head, clear the hobby space, and start this next project from a much better place than I have been working from.

You can see how good these look on the board. I can put them on any square here, and they pop in and just look great and blend right in. So, it'll be good to have some line of sight blocking on the board. Pretty happy with how these turned out.

But the bad news is I won't be able to get back downstairs to record. I'm now officially all caught up with work and life responsibilities. So tomorrow I can return back to normal and start upping the quality of these.
