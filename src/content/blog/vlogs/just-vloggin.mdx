## Transcript

Did y'all forget about the Mangler Squigs? Because I did. So, I go through hitting these guys. Now, one thing I want to point out with these guys is we are not just like—I'm leaving some black. It's probably the easier way of saying that. I'm not trying to like perfectly base coat it.

One, because we're going to make these rusty to match our spears. So, we're going to do a brown wash over this. And that'll also kind of like pick up and correct any mistakes of where I overlapped on the red. But just by keeping the black in, it's going to help establish that border and almost like consider it like black lining between the skin and the chain. And when we wash it, it's not going to be as stark. And that way having that black in the shadows and the recesses will just add—it'll just make it look better because it's going to add contrast. And it's also easier to paint because I'm really only catching the tops. On some things I'm going in on the sides and like getting it all where it's going to be like super bright and super noticeable. But it was actually pretty easy to not mess up the red doing this.

Last spear. I got most of them done upstairs. That was the last one. They're ready to be rusted. I did not get anywhere near as much painting as I thought was going to happen. Today was actually a pretty rough one. But everything's good now. It was a little bit iffy there in the middle of the day. But we're good now.

And the spears are all done. I sat at the table production and craft time with the kids. I loaded them all up, got all the spears done. It took me—I don't know, honestly, like it was that fast to paint one and it still took me like an hour to do. Hour or two, probably.

I think it's going to look good when it was all said and done. Making sure my brush is clean. So I still have to do the rest on them. Let me get in frame. But the main thing left is going to be the skin. So the skin and the bone. The bone I'm just going to do quick little bit of Vallejo Air White and I'm going to go over top of it with Bony Matter. I get a really cool look doing it that way. You get a really cool look like this. So this is just white with Bony Matter over it.

And hopefully we can get to focus. I got weird lighting right now because it's a weird time of day. Got to go back. I painted some of these non-metallic metal-ish, but I'm going to go back and I'll probably do gold on the bracelets just because I like how the yellow pops. And then we just need to do the nails and the teeth and the skin. But again, that'll all be pretty fast because I've got that system worked out pretty good. And I think I'm going to do some purple on the eyes maybe like the Instagram post we're stealing from.

Main thing is we're 2 days into November and I painted every day.

I just came across this vampire warband from Gardens of Hecate. I've been always trying to catch their Kickstarters and I always miss them. So, I'm stoked that I finally caught this. So, I'm just sharing it with you guys. If you want this one, you can get just this one, but you can also get all of their previous ones, which is what I'm most excited about. I've wanted these for a very long time. So, I'm going to make sure I purge enough to be able to back this because it's over in the next 10 days. So, I'll put the link in the description for this because I definitely want to go all in on everything.

All right, so going into this week, got to finish Goblin Town. I cannot spend any more time on these goblins. It's literally been a whole month of nothing but goblins. Hours and hours and hours of goblins. I don't think I'll ever try to paint 90 of the same model ever again. I don't think I have it in me anymore. I was going into this thinking it'd be pretty easy and then just between a lot of like just life happening I realized that it's just not possible to paint 90 goblins in a couple of days anymore. Those days are over for me.

It's been a lot of fun. I'm glad I stuck with it. I'm talking like I finished it when I haven't—like I still have to do the skin and the bone stuff and that's going to be a process too, but it's going to be much faster than the robes or and much faster than even building them. So like in my mind this is pretty much done because I know like tomorrow I'll get to paint. Wednesday I'll get to paint, Thursday I'll get to paint. I mean every day I'm going to get to paint. So I know that this going into next week goblins are going to be done. We're going to get out of Goblin Town.

We did all of and didn't actually paint an orc which doesn't feel very good. But you know, that's just how it goes. I thought for sure I'd be able to finish the Orcs and Goblins army. So it's weird that I just made a bunch of videos about how I didn't accomplish what I wanted to do, but I think that's real. I think it's probably hopefully entertaining watching somebody like fail miserably at painting their army project because I still have—like I didn't touch a single orc really.

But knowing that the 90 goblins are done is going to—like even if the orcs sit for another couple months, which they probably will honestly because I'm over it. I'm over it. That's okay because I stuck with this project. 90 goblins was a real project. Even though the army is all playable. Even though I stuck with the goblins, I just couldn't. It was the goblins beat me. Honestly, the goblins beat me. Especially with all the problems I ran into.

I'm still—I'm very proud of this tongue though. Like the tongues are so good. Even with my terrible lighting, the tongues turned out so good.

But I want to do the vampire halflings because if I do play Old World anytime soon, those are going to be what I'm going to play right now. And then if for some reason I decide to like really take it seriously, I'll probably pick up Orcs and Goblins just because it's not legacy and it's going to be like my long-term Old World plans are going to be Orcs and Goblins, but in the short term, I just want to get some Vampire Counts in one because I think it'll probably get nerfed. I want to play because it's super strong. I just really like those figures and I also just really love like the necromancer stuff and bring stuff back from the dead. I think it's cool.

So, I want to get that painted and it's going to be easy to paint because that's going to be mostly airbrush work and then a little bit of brush work. Whereas this was like a lot of like prep work with the airbrush, but none of the actual painting. Like all the painting's been brush work, which has been brutal.

So, I don't even really know what the point of this video is other than I'm showing up getting a ton of hobby time, not getting a ton of hobby time and getting like the bare minimum amount of hobby time and finding ways to do that.

And just don't let them—don't let them beat you. Don't let the bastards grind you down like they did to me. I'll see you tomorrow.

Tomorrow is going to be—I'm going to do some real casting tomorrow now that the vacuum chamber. I'm going to cast some toads. Hopefully tomorrow is finally the announcement video that I've got some toads for sale. Which is going to be really cool just to like spread them out into the world. Hopefully people are there that want to buy some of them so they can also recast and do this really cool thing.

And Building Dusk Tuesday night is hopefully a painting the Fantasm stream. So I got lots of fun things that are not goblins planned this week but the goblins will—no matter what I'm finishing the goblins by Friday. If I got to stay up all night I'm getting the goblins off the workbench and into the display cabinet this week. So thanks.
