## The Mangler Squigs Return

Did y'all forget about the mangler squigs? Because I did. Now I'm going through hitting these guys.

One thing to point out—I'm leaving some black showing. I'm not trying to perfectly base coat it because we're going to make these rusty to match our spears, so a brown wash is coming. By keeping the black in the shadows and recesses, it adds contrast and makes things easier because I'm really only catching the tops.

## Production Time with the Kids

Got most of the spears done upstairs during craft time with the kids. It was that fast to paint one spear, but it still took me an hour or two to do them all.

## The Final Stretch

The main thing left is skin and bone. The bone I'm doing with Vallejo air white plus bony matter over it—you get a really cool look that way. Going to do gold on the bracelets since I like how the yellow pops. Then just nails, teeth, and skin.

## Two Days Into November

Main thing is we're 2 days into November and I painted every day.

## Gardens of Hecati Discovery

Just came across this vampire warband from Gardens of Hecati. I've been trying to catch their Kickstarters and always miss them. This one lets you get all their previous ones too, which is what I'm most excited about. Going to make sure I purge enough to back this—it's over in 10 days.

## Goblin Reality Check

Going into this week, I've got to finish Goblin Town. It's literally been a whole month of nothing but goblins—hours and hours and hours. I don't think I'll ever try to paint 90 of the same model ever again.

I went in thinking it'd be pretty easy. Between life happening, I realized it's just not possible to paint 90 goblins in a couple days anymore. Those days are over for me.

## The Plan

The goblins beat me, honestly. But I'm finishing them by Friday. If I have to stay up all night, I'm getting them off the workbench and into the display cabinet this week.

Tomorrow is casting toads, and Tuesday night is hopefully a painting stream. Lots of fun things that are not goblins planned this week.
