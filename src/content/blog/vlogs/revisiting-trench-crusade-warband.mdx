## Back to the Pilgrims

Taking some time to revisit my Trench Crusade warband. There are always little details you notice after the fact that could use some attention.

## Touch-Up Work

Going through the models and fixing small things—cleaning up edges, punching up highlights, fixing spots I missed the first time around. It's tedious but necessary work.

## Getting Game Ready

With games coming up, I want these models looking their best on the table. Nothing ruins immersion like noticing unpainted spots or sloppy details during a game.

## The Iterative Process

This is just part of the hobby. Very few models are truly "done" on the first pass. Coming back with fresh eyes often reveals things you missed, and that's okay. It's all part of the process.
