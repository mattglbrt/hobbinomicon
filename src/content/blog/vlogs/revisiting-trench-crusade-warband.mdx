## Transcript

So, I've been going back through just finishing up all the loose ends and putting things away. And I realized that now as I'm looking at the Trench Crusade project and kind of putting it on the shelf and revisiting it, now that the oils have dried, I think that there is a lot more we could do here and come back in with some highlights. Like, we could really make these metallics pop. We could revisit our skin and our flesh and these fabrics and just kind of add another layer of highlights in.

I think we kind of speed painted these guys and I'm happy with how they look. I think they still overall turned out great. But I'm just looking back in now and I'm seeing like I could really make these guys pop with a small amount of work. And I think that's what I'm going to do tonight and going to give myself this weekend to finish up all these loose ends.

See, if I look—I'm looking at the lens right now and it doesn't like when I—and I'm looking at the playback, it doesn't look like I'm actually looking at the lens. So, I don't know what's been going on with that. Like I'm looking in the middle of the screen, looking at the lens. Middle of the screen, lens. So, hopefully it works now and I can use that trick and see what's going on.

But today is Friday, November 14th. Day 60-something. I need to start tracking that. That'd be cool to do in the video. But it's loose end project weekend. So, Trench Crusade touch-ups because I'm actually going to play Trench Crusade next week finally. They're finally going to get some table time painted. I've only played them before I had them painted. Goblins—got to get those guys done so I can move in to the next project that I really wanted.

First, I'm going to come back in with some Vallejo Steel. All right. Nothing crazy—just I don't know, 20 minutes of edge highlighting and it's made a huge difference. Edge highlighting, just picking the metals back out. I need to go back through and do flesh and reds, but I think that'll be a job for tomorrow.
