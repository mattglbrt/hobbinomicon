## The Gaming Table is Clear

Look at this! Would you look at this? Look at my nice clean gaming table—it's finally clear again. Now I can use this as a staging area for sorting everything else.

It still looks terrible, but I didn't just dump stuff. A lot is either gone or put away where it should go.

## Still Riding the Trench Crusade High

Still riding that Trench Crusade high from last night. Really miss those days of rolling dice all night with the big group found-family kind of style. Don't get to do that as much as I used to.

I've only played Trench Crusade twice now and it's been so much fun both times. I want to finish up a couple more figures for my Trench Pilgrims, but I'm already eyeing the next group for the January campaign. Time to project hop as always.

## December 7th Deadline

Next order of business is my first 50 points of Dusk for December 7th. Got everything built but need to figure out bases.

The only one I'm going to have painted by then is my character—we're doing a painting competition. I'm going to put all my time into her. She'll be my first one trying to get good at really going all out on a miniature.

## Setting Up the Space

Now that I have this area organized, I'm going to move stuff around for better camera setup—not just my phone I'm walking in circles rambling about.

I want to try one night a week as solo RPG night. Not sure if I'll do live actual play or take what happens and make a narrative story out of it.

## The Simple Base Decision

With the tactical rock on the 30mm base, there isn't a ton I can do. I kind of like the simplicity, so I might just add some base texture and glue her directly to the base. Lessons learned with the goblins.

## The Power of Organization

I knew exactly where my glue was. I knew exactly where my basing material was. I knew exactly where my X-Acto knife and magnets were.

I was able to clean the base, magnetize the bottom of it in like 30 seconds. Way faster just because I knew where all my stuff was. Put it all away again, back in the toolbox.

It really does make a huge difference being organized. That's the lesson for today.

See you tomorrow where I'm actually going to paint!
