## Transcript

Look at this. Would you look at this? Look at my nice clean gaming table. It is finally clear again. So now I'm going to use this to start sorting anything that's still left and like a staging area. So now I'll be able to actually like clean up the bookshelf, clean up these other shelves over here. This is a very productive day that is probably going to be a very boring video.

Still have—and all that—a lot of this stuff is sorted. Like it looks terrible still, but I didn't just like dump stuff off of there. A lot of that stuff is either gone or put away where it should go.

Still really riding that Trench Crusade high. Let me change my background. Still riding that Trench Crusade high from last night. Just really kind of miss those days of rolling dice all night and kind of like the big group found family kind of style of thing. Just really cool. Don't get to do that as much as I used to.

And now I'm just—I've only played Trench Crusade twice now and it has been so much fun both times I've played it. I want to finish up—there's a couple more figures I want to finish up painting for my Trench Pilgrims, but I'm already kind of eyeing the next group that I want for the next campaign, which I think will probably be starting in January. So, time to project hop as always.

No, today actually turned into a pretty crazy workday. But what's next in order is my first 50 points of Dusk for December 7th. So, I got everything built, but I need to get it assembled. And I have the Phantasm—is also built and ready to go, but I don't have it in here yet. But, so I got to figure out how I'm going to base—what I'm going to do for bases so I can get these guys based. And really, the only one of these that I'm going to have painted by December 7th is my character because we're doing a little painting competition for a character. So, I'm going to pretty much put all of my time into her.

And she'll be like my first one of trying to get good at this process of really trying to go all out on a miniature. It's either gonna be her or maybe her. Haven't decided actually now that I say that.

But that's going to be the next bit of painting going forward. Now that I have this area right—I have this area—going to keep cleaning. Going to move stuff around so I can get like better camera that's not just my phone that I'm running, walking in circles rambling about. So, going to set up like—I want to try to do like one night a week be like solo RPG night. And I don't know if I'm going to do like a live, like a real play, or I'm going to take what happens during me playing and make like a narrative—like a story—kind of like a cool little story night.

I was thinking with the tactical rock on the 30mm base, there really isn't a ton I could do. I mean, I could—I guess I could do a ton and I could add more tactical rocks, but I kind of like the simplicity of this base. So, I think I actually might just for her add some of the base texture. I'm going to glue her directly to the base because my lessons have been learned with the goblins.

And that just might be what the hobby part is today because I just spent so many hours on the table. So, I think a lot of you probably are already aware of it, but I knew exactly where my glue was. I knew exactly where my basing material was, and I knew exactly where my X-Acto knife and magnets were. So, I was able to base—clean the base up, magnetize the bottom of it in like 30 seconds, which is pretty crazy. Way faster just because I knew where all my stuff was. Put it all away again, back in the toolbox.

So, it really does just make a huge difference being organized. So, that's the lesson for today. Thanks for watching. See you tomorrow where I'm actually going to paint.
