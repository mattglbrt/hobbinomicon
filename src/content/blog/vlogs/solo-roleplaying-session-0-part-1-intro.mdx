## Welcome to Crown & Skull

This is the first part of my solo roleplaying journey using the Crown & Skull system. I've been wanting to get into solo RPGs for a while now, and this seemed like the perfect system to start with.

## What is Crown & Skull?

Crown & Skull is a rules-light fantasy RPG that's designed to be played solo or with a group. It uses a simple d6 system and emphasizes narrative storytelling over complex mechanics. Perfect for someone like me who wants to focus on the story rather than getting bogged down in rules.

## Meet Thorn

For this campaign, I've created a character named Thorn. I won't spoil too much about the backstory here, but suffice to say there's plenty of room for adventure and character development.

## The Journey Begins

This is session zero, so we're mostly just setting up the world and getting familiar with the system. In future episodes, we'll dive into actual adventures and see where the story takes us.

I'm excited to share this journey with you all. Solo RPGs are a great way to scratch that tabletop itch when you can't get a group together, and they're also fantastic for developing storytelling skills.
