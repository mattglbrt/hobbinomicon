## The Streak Must Continue

Look guys. I got a vasectomy earlier today and I hobbied through:
- RSV
- Bronchitis (that I got from the RSV)
- Pneumonia
- An emergency room trip to get oxygen

I didn't break the hobby streak then. I'm not going to break it now.

## Tonight's Project

I've been meaning to go back into this Butcher model and paint the candy cane on his weapon. Got my relatively new size one sable brush and I'm just going to paint some stripes.

Not going to lie - I'm in a lot of pain right now. Making my hand shake a little. This might have to be cleaned up tomorrow, but I've started the process.

## The Process

Realized I was painting on primer - that's why it felt weird. Changed plans: paint the whole thing red first, then do the white stripes later.

Also remembered this is the brush I don't like because it's acting weird. Need to switch that out.

Want this to be a different red than the robe, so I'm using Primary Red.

## The Actual Operation

If you're curious - the operation part was super fast. Didn't feel a thing. But 9 hours later? It sucks.

## The Point

This is going to be a quick one. Maybe I'll even add some red to the gauntlets and highlight this up because I love this model and want to revisit it.

I've put paint on a model every day this year. Even if it's just a single coat of paint, the streak continues.

If I can do it during all those other times, I can do it today.

See you tomorrow.
