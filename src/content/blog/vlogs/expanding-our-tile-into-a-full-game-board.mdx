## Transcript

Hey. Hi. So I said I wasn't going to talk that much about the other boards, but one thing I'm doing is now that it's glued to the foam, I'm like rolling it. Can you see what's going on here? The cracks. So, like I'm peeling it like this and then putting Mod Podge in the side. And I did that like this way and this way. So, now this boy is going to be locked in when that dries. I just finished getting glue into all of these and I have them into the leftover scrap wood jig just so they don't warp. And I'm going to—I'll rotate them since I don't have a piece to go in here. I made one more. So this one you can see like the edges are all going to match up to the other tiles, but it's starting the deterioration of the bricks.

So now I'll have single board for my crew that started this enough for like a 2x2 skirmish board. Which I think I'm probably gonna have to make a game for. Like the board is demanding that I make a world, I make a game. Gonna do that. Figure that out. But then I got this idea that I ripped the tiles out and I didn't do it evenly. And I went outside and did all the other ones. So I'm about to put a respirator on, but I got the heat gun and just watch what happens.

All right. And now I've got these things in the press because I am afraid that because of the heat they'll curl and I'm hoping this will stop that. Okay, I got six boards in the drill press flattening out. I've got six on the table here. So that's 12. And I have the one I already made. I'm hoping the ones in the drill press stay flat, but if not, I've got enough for like this 2x3, which I think is fun because it's fun to start. And I've got a ton more cubes. So, worst case scenario, if the flat ones don't work out, I'll just make more cube ones.
