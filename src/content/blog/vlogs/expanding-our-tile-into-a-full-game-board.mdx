## Locking In the Tiles

Now that it's glued to foam, I'm rolling it to create cracks. Peeling it up, putting Mod Podge in the sides, then pressing down. Did this in both directions—this thing will be locked in when it dries.

## Building the Collection

Got all the tiles in leftover scrap wood jigs so they don't warp. Made one more where the edges match the other tiles but it's starting the deterioration of the bricks.

Now I have:
- Single board for my crew
- Enough for a 2x2 skirmish board
- The board is demanding I make a world, make a game for it

## Heat Gun Magic

Ripped the tiles out unevenly, went outside, and hit them with a heat gun. Now everything's in the press because I'm afraid the heat will make them curl.

## The Count

Six boards in the drill press, six on the table—that's 12 plus the one already made. If the flat ones don't work out, I've got enough for a 2x3 which is fun to start. And I have tons more cubes for backup.

Worst case: I'll just make more cube ones.
