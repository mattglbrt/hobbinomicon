## Support Removal Day

Today was support removal day. I missed some on the Phantasm and need to magnetize a few more parts, but I got Iron Soul Nick cleaned up, Heretics cleaned up, random Black Grail stuff, and an Ammo Monk that I needed cleaned up, and all of Quartz cleaned up.

I think I'm done printing everything for Trench Crusade. I need to print an Assassin for Iron Sultanate, maybe two more in case I want to play that sub-faction. But I have everything else I'd possibly want to play in Trench Crusade printed.

## Everything Built Faster Than Expected

Got Warmachine handled. Infinity built. All my Old World Warhammer stuff built. All the RPG miniatures mostly built and based.

I got all that done a lot faster than I thought. There's definitely going to be stuff that pops up next year that I want to paint, but I'm not buying anything new—at least for the first six months.

This means I could probably get everything primed before the new year. Then I can really just focus the rest of the year on painting without distractions or excuses.

## Setting Up the RPG Hole

I'm turning this whole area into my little RPG hole. Clean RPG table, dice in here, RPG books on the freshly organized bookshelf.

Finally got tracking information for Dolmenwood! I'm probably the last person in North America getting it. I have the Max Pledge with a bunch of add-ons.

## The Book of Antithesis

A lot of stuff in this book is pretty cringe—and I think that's by design. But some of it is actually very cool.

This book attempts to merge entry-level occult and magical practices—which is really just introspection and meditation—into role-playing games. It's Lamentations of the Flame Princess, so you know what you're in for: 50% cringe, 50% cool stuff, but usually 100% good games.

## Ceremonial Dice

I followed the instructions for ceremonial dice. They describe the type of dice you should get, colors, and corresponding planetary influences and elements. I've already done all these steps for all of my dice—one of every color pretty much.

The concept is correlating your dice to planets and planetary influences—like calm or cool or collected if you use the blue dice. It adds another level of immersion into the game.

## The Art Warning

The art in this book is certainly nothing I could ever have on the YouTube channel. Very not safe for work. Very not child-friendly. That part of it is what it is—I get what the author was going for, and that's pretty much what all Lamentations products are like.

Instead of showing you the pages, I'll just tell you when I'm taking aspects from it when the actual role-playing starts.

## Post-Holiday Recovery

Really just a day of recovery from the holidays. Always a lot when you've got to do that. It's fun to see everybody, but it takes a day of getting back to normal—especially because the kids get so tired and crazy.

As you can probably hear them running around, I've got to get back upstairs!
