## Settlement Phase Deep Dive

Now that I know KDM is really going to be my thing, I need better long-term storage and organization. Time to clean up this table.

### Crafting Session

Building with our resources:
- Two Lion Guitars
- King Spear
- White Lion Coat
- Three organs through the Organ Grinder

### Character Updates

**Sophia** - Got more weapon proficiency boxes checked. She's our fist and tooth specialist.

**Theren** - Choosing bow proficiency. Got Timeless Eye (perfect hit on 9 or 10). Aged up for weapon proficiency.

**Kip** - Choosing spear since I'm making the King Spear. Got Crazed (perfect hit gives +1 insanity).

**Clinestra** - Got Mighty Strike (perfect hit +2 strength). Choosing guitar to upgrade her scrap sword.

### The Perfect Organ Gamble

The baby from intimacy has a perfect organ. Rolling for the organ grinder - if we get a 6+, he gains +10 hunt XP, power-leveling him instantly.

Rolled an 8. He jumps through multiple age milestones:
- +1 permanent luck
- +1 strength
- +1 movement
- Another +1 luck

He's critting on 8s with nothing else. Monster.

### The Weapon Proficiency Problem

Wait - he doesn't have enough fights left to actually master a proficiency. By giving him all that hunt XP, he can only get 6 weapon proficiency points total.

He'll be our ringer - if the main archer dies, this guy can pop in with the death mask and crit on 4+. But I won't use him in regular hunts because it hurts our mastery progression.

### Population Management

Using Clinestra as matchmaker with intimacy events. She's deaf but has the Matchmaker ability. Going to rotate her in and out to keep getting survivors.

Settlement at 8 population now. Want to hit 10 for safety margin.

### Final Party Loadout

- **Sophia** - White lion cloak, lion headdress, bone club (can pounce now!)
- **Kip** - Death mask + catgut bow (our crit fisher with +1 luck)
- **Theren** - King spear, rawhide armor
- **Alexios** - Lion guitars, ready to deal damage

This session took about 1.5 hours of real time. If this were a weekly thing, set aside 2-3 hours to get through a hunt phase every session.

Next up: the Screaming Antelope!
