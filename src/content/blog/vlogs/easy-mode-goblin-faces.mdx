## Making Goblin Faces Pop

I'm going to show you how to really make goblin faces look good. We're starting with a face that's already got Shamrock Green speed paint over the yellow and black preshade. I'm using a big thick brush just to show you that you don't need some crazy detailed brush.

## The Teeth Process

First, lime green glaze consistency (think skim milk, maybe a little less). Hit the raised edges, starting in shadows and pulling out to where light hits most.

Then Vallejo air white—any white works. We want this pretty thick on the brush. The yellow and purple from our underpainting already did most of our work. Spin your brush into a point and very lightly hit just the tops of the teeth. Leave some yellow showing. Don't take it all the way to the gum line.

## The Wash Step

Now burnt umber (or any brown)—very thin and transparent. Come back in on the teeth and let it pool in the ridges. Use capillary action to pull excess off. Now the teeth look nasty but still pop from a distance.

## Refining the Teeth

Mix a bit of white with the wash color for an off-white, then dab just the very bottoms of the teeth. Keep the brown in the cracks and near the gums.

## The Gums

Squid pink, thick because it's hard to get where you want it the first time. Angle your brush with any imperfections in the bristles and carefully hit the gums. It blends with the purple from our underpaint.

## The Lips

Arctic blue from Scale Color on the bottom lip using the curved tip of the brush. See how crazy it looks with that blue against the pink? Then stipple carefully to create lip texture and highlights without getting paint where you don't want it.

## Optional Pink Glaze

If the green is fully dry, you can hit the underside of the nose with a very transparent pink glaze. Be careful—if it's not dry or you go too thin, it'll water stain.

## The Result

About 8 minutes per face gets you a focal point that distracts from simpler paint jobs elsewhere. When you have 90 goblins, having faces that pop makes a huge difference. We didn't even paint the eyes and it still looks great.

These vlogs are really what's keeping me together right now. Thanks for watching.
