## Day Two: No Plan

Welcome to day two. I have no idea what I'm doing—and that's on purpose.

I've tried to start a YouTube channel so many times. I come up with all these plans: two videos a week, talk about this, then that. I never make the videos. I spend all my time planning things that never happen.

So instead, I'm just going to keep going every day without a plan and see how far that gets me.

## Don't Run From Mistakes

Normally, if I messed up a paint job like I did with this robe (by messed up, I mean I just don't like how it looks), I would have thrown him into the bits box or back on the shelf, never to be touched again. He'd serve forever as a memory of my failure.

I'm being hypercritical of my own work. It doesn't actually look that bad. I just slapped some speed paint on it, so of course it doesn't look good.

## The Fix

Instead of being frustrated by not getting the results I wanted the first time, I sat back down with him. Pulled out a couple different blues—dark blue, very bright blue, middle blue. They all have that green or violet teal tone.

Now I'm just reworking it:
1. Paint the shadows dark
2. Add the midtone on top
3. Paint highlights on top

That's the tutorial, guys.

## Black Mage Inspiration

By now you can see the inspiration: Black Mage from Final Fantasy 1, or Vivi from Final Fantasy IX.

It turned out pretty good in the end. The arms and feet I just started with a dark color, worked my way up with a lighter gray.

## The Lesson

The main thing I want to talk about today: don't be afraid to make mistakes. After you make them, don't run from them.

Now I'm looking at him and I'm pretty happy with how he turned out. I think it looks pretty great. I pretty much completely covered up the speed paint. The skin looks great, the staff looks great (which was just layering), and I'm very happy with the robe.

All because I made myself sit back down with it and work on it instead of running from the mistakes.

## Tomorrow

Tomorrow I'm going to finish this guy and then start on my terrain board for Mollog's Crew.
