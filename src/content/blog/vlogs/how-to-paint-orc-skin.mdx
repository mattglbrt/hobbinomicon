## Transcript

Today I have a no-nonsense guide on painting grimdark pale orc flesh like this or like this one.

And if you want to do cool spit effects like this, it's just UHU glue on the model. We got UHU and you just dab it on with a toothpick. It's that easy.

First you want to start with Pallid Witch Flesh. Just base coat it all over the model.

Next, you mix Quickshade Wash Medium with Bugman's Glow 50/50. And then we put that on the mouth, the hands, and the elbows. Anywhere that's going to be like pinker flesh.

Now, we just cover all the model with Streaking Grime. And then we wipe it away with just a sponge and a Q-tip to get to this point. And that's what turns our skin green.

And then we'll come back in with mineral spirits on things like the very tops of the muscles and the teeth and the nails. And that's how we get to here.

And then next I'll use Menoth White from P3 to paint the nails and the teeth and highlight the very tops of the muscles on the back. You can really see it on the shoulders here.

And then in some places I'll go back and just do a small wash of Carroburg Crimson on those places where we put Bugman's Glow.

And for the last bit, just put a white dot for beady little eyes. And there you go. Very fast, very effective.

If you're still here, thanks for making it to the end of the video. I thought it'd be faster to turn that into a short, but it cropped it poorly. So, I just also uploaded it here for full wide frame footage of it.

Those are my Age of Sigmar orcs. I've sold most of them. And I actually made that guide while I was making them for myself. Like, I just took pictures. So, because I did it like army-wide and it was a ton of work at the time and I just didn't want to forget what I was doing.

But I saw this comment which I'll post right here and it reminded me that I had those photos still so I can show you my take on grimdark orcs which is also really fast because especially if you have an airbrush you can just airbrush Pallid Witch Flesh and kind of be done with it. Other than the Streaking Grime, but here's what they look like up close now. And also a Warchanter that I just spent a little extra time on the face, like 20 minutes extra on the face, you can get really good results.

And I still have these two guys. And you can see they're way more green—they come out way more green. But it's still that pale color. Pretty sick. Love this guy. This guy's one of my favorites. I don't think I'd ever get rid of him just because the mouth's so gnarly.

Goblin update is they're coming along. All the black is done. Didn't get a chance to do the skin today. Son got sick, so I was just kind of hanging out, keeping him happy. Tomorrow's Warmachine day. Very, very excited. Been watching the World Team Championship for Warmachine all day while I was working on my goblins. So, ready to roll some dice which I will cover tomorrow. See you then.
