## Transcript

Today I have a no-nonsense guide on painting grimdark pale orc flesh like this or like this one.

And if you want to do cool spit effects like this, it's just UHU glue on the model. We got UHU and you just dab it on with a toothpick. It's that easy.

First you want to start with Pallid Witch Flesh. Just base coat it all over the model.

Next, you mix Quickshade Wash Medium with Bugman's Glow 50/50. And then we put that on the mouth, the hands, and the elbows. Anywhere that's going to be like pinker flesh.

Now, we just cover all the model with Streaking Grime. And then we wipe it away with just a sponge and a Q-tip to get to this point. And that's what turns our skin green.

And then we'll come back in with mineral spirits on things like the very tops of the muscles and the teeth and the nails. And that's how we get to here.

And then next I'll use Menoth White from P3 to paint the nails and the teeth and highlight the very tops of the muscles on the back. You can really see it on the shoulders here.

And then in some places I'll go back and just do a small wash of Carroburg Crimson on those places where we put Bugman's Glow.

And for the last bit, just put a white dot for beady little eyes. And there you go. Very fast, very effective.
