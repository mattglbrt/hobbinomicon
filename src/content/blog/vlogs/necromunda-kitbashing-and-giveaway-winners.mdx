## Necromunda Kit Bashing Time

Going through the bits box and this guy looks very Rogue Trader-ish to me. He's going to be an Ogryn. I think we're going Venator gang because I have a ton of crazy kit bashes I want to do—totally 100% kit bashed is the plan.

## Works in Progress from the Bits Box

Found a bunch of abandoned works in progress at the bottom of the bits box. One has a robe that's like a highly sought-after conversion piece. Another is pretty much done—an Ungor inspired guy. I sculpted on a cloak with green stuff a long time ago, and I'm still kind of proud of him.

## The Squat Prospectors Sprue

Just remembered I had a whole unopened box meant for Necromunda. I got it mostly for the weapons because I don't actually like this version of the Squats—I like the Leagues of Votann much more. But the wheels are turning.

## Mold Line Tip

Got those mold lines shaved off the tops, but there's still stuff in the cracks. Using plastic cement to melt what's left of the mold line down in those cracks.

## Giveaway Winners

Using pickawinner.co to randomly pick from the comments. Congrats to Campaign Terrain and Caleb Paints Miniatures! Shoot me a DM with your shipping info.

## The Kit Bash Results

**Gun Guy**: Didn't even use the Prospector arms. Need to drill barrels but looks pretty sick.

**Melee Ungor**: Swapped out the gun on his back for a hammer pick thing. He's got a strong hand and a tiny arm—doesn't actually use the hammer, just carries it around because he likes it.

**Servitor Guy**: AdMech legs, old Crypt Ghouls torso, Chaos Cultist bolt pistol hand, Flesh Tearer chainsword (that's why it's longer than normal), AdMech head and back.

**Flail Guy**: Body and flail arm from old Chaos Cultist, belt across chest is pouches and grenades with green stuff, tiny arm is Crypt Ghouls, shoulder pad from Orcs kit, head is Ungor, pick is from Leagues of Votann.

We've got four ragtag guys—off to a good start!
