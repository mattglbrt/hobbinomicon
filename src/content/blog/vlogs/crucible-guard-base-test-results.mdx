## Day 102: Starting to Feel Better

Today's an improvement. Definitely not back to normal, but I fixed the supports on the objective so it actually prints. And my base idea worked!

You can see it actually looks like it's meant to be on the base. It's not insane. Very happy with how they turned out.

## The Base Insert Solution

Now that I know that's going to work, I went through and made a plate that's all 50mm, a plate that's all 40mm, and a plate that's all 30mm.

This way looks a lot better because see here—on this one, how the dirt is still recessed in the base and the plates are on top. If you had just had the base insert normally, all the dirt would have been up and there'd been a huge thick rim. The base insert itself was as thick as that pipe, so it just looks really silly to me doing it the normal way.

## Progress Despite Being Sick

Even despite being as sick as I was, I was able to get these bases figured out and all my files prepped. I'll probably print these over the next couple of days because I'm probably a little bit over 3D printing honestly after doing all of Trench Crusade and now Crucible Guard.

I'm glad the rest of Crucible Guard isn't coming until the 29th because I'm ready to put 3D printing away.

## 100 Subscribers!

We hit 100 subs! That's crazy. That's awesome. Thank you all for subscribing. It's pretty cool.

## The Board Plan

I was thinking about this board—what I'm going to do is get a crazy high, very light tan color dry brush first, then oil wash it. That way I can just be done with it and not have to worry about the dry brush after the oil wash.

Really happy with how it looks from the paint. Now we just kind of dry brush and call it done.
