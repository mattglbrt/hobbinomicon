## Necromunda Kitbashing

Going through the bits box. This guy looks very Rogue Trader-ish to me. He's going to be an Ogryn.

I think we're going with a Venator gang just because I have a ton of crazy kitbashes I want to do. Plan is 100% kitbashed.

## Bits Box Archaeology

These were works in progress that got abandoned at some point. Got so much cat hair on them. But I think I might pick these back up for this project.

This robe guy is like a key highly sought-after conversion. This one's pretty much done—an Ungor-inspired guy. I sculpted on the cloak with green stuff. Still kind of proud of this guy.

## The Squat Prospector Sprue

I had an unopened box meant for Necromunda. Got this mostly for the weapons—I don't actually like this version of the squats, prefer Leagues of Votann. But the wheels are starting to turn.

## Tip of the Evening

Got mold lines shaved off the tops but there's still stuff in the cracks. Just use plastic cement to melt what's left of the mold line down in those cracks.

## Giveaway Winners

Using pickawinner.co to randomly pick from that video:
- **First frog**: Campaign Terrain—congrats, you've been around a while!
- **Second frog**: Caleb Paints Miniatures

Thanks, guys. Shoot me a DM with your info.

## The Builds

### The Iron Head Guy
Didn't even use the Prospector arms. Looks pretty sick. Need to do a little cleanup and drill barrels.

### The Melee Guy
Swapped out the gun on his back for a hammer pick thing. He's got a strong hand and a little tiny arm. I don't know what he thinks he's doing with that hammer—he just carries it around because he likes it. More Ungor than Beastman inspired.

### The Servitor Guy
He's going to fit in very well with our Ogryn guy. Going to do something with the backpack. Don't know why I drilled that hole there.

### The Admech/Cultist Mashup
- Admech legs
- Old Crypt Ghouls torso
- Old Chaos Cultist bolt pistol hand
- Flesh Tearer chain sword (that's why it's longer than normal)
- Admech head and back

### The Flail Guy
- Body and flail arm: old Chaos Cultist
- Belt across chest: pouches and grenades with green stuff
- Tiny arm: Crypt Ghouls
- Shoulder pad: from the Orcs kit
- Head: Ungor head
- Pick: Leagues of Votann kit
