## Transcript

Necromunda is turning me into a junk rat because I saw a Rogue Trader kit for $30 on eBay and I said I need that. So now we have a random pile of these miniatures from the Rogue Trader kit. So on this one, you can kind of see. I took a Venator gang body and then I just have that head sitting on top of there right now.

So my idea for this one is—can I zoom in? This guy right here. This is a—it's an Ogryn. I forget what it's called in the lore. I don't have the Rogue Trader Codex or anything like that. But this guy right here is kind of what I'm trying to recreate, maybe not exactly the same, but that kind of beefy guy. And on top of this Venator, this regular human body, this head will just be kind of giving that look of maybe an abhuman, maybe he's got some kind of like servitor-esque, like maybe it's the armor that's big and he's wired in. Or maybe he's a mutant, right? So just a lot of cool stuff there.

On this one right here, we have—again, Venator gang. We have what I think is—I don't even know where that head came from. I think it might be from the same kit. I think it's like from this guy maybe. I don't know. But that's just—I really loved that head. Like there was no real thought behind it. I love that head and I said I'm going to put this head on a dude. So you can see this guy right here as well. Kind of looking like a badass. I think on this model, the right arm is from a Crypt Ghouls kit, so Flesh-eater Courts. I just thought that would be cool, like a very fleshy kind of almost Chaos-looking skin arm. I don't know. I don't really play in the Necromunda universe, so it's going to be a lot of rule of cool in terms of converting.

Here's this guy again. So we have body from Venator gang, head from Rogue Trader, arms from Crypt Ghouls, and then feet—or just the foot—from a Leagues of Votann. So it's got those cool boots. And it also adds a little bit of height, which kind of ties the whole thing together. We've got a little pistol here. That's a Cultist arm—Chaos Cultist arm. Again, Venator gang body. Head from, I think, that's from a Kairic Acolytes box, and then some Ungor bits for the horns.

On this guy, I don't want to turn away too much. Venator gang body. Admech head. I actually had to carve out a little bit of this hood to get that head in there. And then I have an Admech arm on there right now too. For some reason, I was just like—like I love it but I'm not 100% sold on it, so this one might get a different arm. Actually probably not. I'll probably just keep it. Oh wait, no. The reason I didn't like it is because both guns are on the same side. So maybe I'll try to get a close combat weapon in his other hand or something like that. But it does look pretty sick.

Anyway. So those guys are coming along. We have the giveaway. So I'm going to get this—I'm going to use pickawinner.co to run this thing. So I put in the last video in YouTube. I'm going to copy that. I'm going to paste it in here. Okay, so grab comments. There we go. So we have everybody—Campaign Terrain, Caleb Paints Miniatures, Unpleasant Dreams Gaming. So I mean, it doesn't seem like a lot of people, but this is—to have a hundred subs with these—with these amount of eyes on the video, I mean, I'm very thankful. So there's three of you guys in the giveaway. We'll pick two winners.

So first winner is Campaign Terrain. Congrats, Campaign Terrain. Number two is Caleb Paints Miniatures. So congrats to both of you guys. Reach out—if you can reach out to me via Instagram or leave a comment and I'll respond, let me know how to get in touch with you so I can get those out to you. Again, that is—I think they were the Oathsworn Ranger and what was the other one? I have to go look. But yeah, I'll get those out to you guys.

Thank you guys for watching. Thank you so much for a hundred subscribers. That's so crazy. I'm very happy. This whole journey has been a lot of fun. And I'll see you tomorrow.
