## The First Showdown

Time to fight the White Lion. The AI attacks tell you the process of picking a target—closest threat facing and in range, or closest threat in field of view.

Side note: I thought about getting pimped out dice, but the font on the included dice is really cool. Rolling with them.

## Combat Mechanics Learned

### Monster Attacks

- **Speed** is how many dice the monster rolls (not movement)
- Each hit triggers a hit location roll
- Taking damage to the head immediately knocks you down (I'm using Warmachine knockdown tokens—no way I'm laying these models on their side)

### Survivor Attacks

Each survivor can use different attack profiles:
- **Founding Stone** - Lower accuracy requirement but meant to be thrown once
- **Fist and Tooth** - Higher accuracy needed (8+) but is Deadly, giving better crit chances

### The Critical Wound System

Sophia went for the Fist and Tooth attack, rolling two dice looking for 8+. She got a 9—a critical wound!

The hit location card showed a reaction, but because it was a critical wound, we cancel the reaction. The result: **we hacked off the monster's hand!** I could spend one survival to gain permanent +1 strength.

This stays in play as a permanent wound. Very cool mechanic.

## The Reality of Kingdom Death

Poor Tmicus got mauled. After taking hits to both arms and needing to roll on the severe injury table... he rolled a one.

**You die of shock.** Your vision fades along with the sight of your mangled, armless torso.

Wow. That's savage. You don't want to roll ones on injury tables.

## The Turning Point

With no AI cards left, we just needed to survive one more basic attack. Sophia took hits—one to the head triggering an injury roll.

A nine: **Shattered Jaw.** She can no longer consume or encourage. Permanent injury. Plus a bleeding token.

But she stood back up, took out her stone, and rolled the final wound. **The lion is dead.**

## Final Thoughts

That felt awesome. The fight was actually pretty quick—probably would have been 15 minutes if I knew what I was doing.

Very meaningful to actually hit the lion. It's pretty hard to hit and do damage.

Our hero Sophia the Strong now has +1 permanent strength but no jaw. I think that's really cool character development through pure gameplay.

**Resources Gained:**
- Four White Lion specific resources
- Four basic resources (monster hide, monster bone)
- One new survivor to replace Tmicus

I'm hooked already. Time to learn about the settlement phase.
