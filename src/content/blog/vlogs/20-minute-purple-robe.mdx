## Last Late Night Video

This is going to be my last late night video for sure. I'm going to start painting first thing in the morning so I can stop doing this twice.

## Testing Speed Paints

I've been curious about what "strong purple" actually means. Continuing our speed paint testing with Moody Mauve on this cloak.

### The Setup

In case you missed the other video: I brush primed this, dry brushed with a warm white (vanilla white), then came back and sketched in more white at the top of the robes. I wanted to get that worn-in, faded look on this purple.

## My Problem as a Painter

I know a problem I have—I try to make my blends too smooth. I put too much into the transition from low to high, so I lose the contrast. There's not a big enough difference between my shadows and highlights.

Here I'm forcing myself to go from dark to bright and have it be crazy. Learning to accept that's okay to do.

## The Stippling Technique

Instead of dragging edge highlights down, I'm going where I would normally edge highlight and just very gently stippling in, building up a highlight.

I'm using an abused brush with a curved tip—actually works well for this. Starting at the very top, just working down with chunky dots following where my dry brush was.

### Going Brighter

I'm taking this highlight way brighter than my brain is telling me to. Almost pure white with a little purple tint. My muscle memory keeps wanting to do subtle highlights, but I'm intentionally going chunky.

## Painting for the Tabletop

I'm specifically trying to paint to make this guy look good at tabletop level. At 2-3 feet away, it looks pretty cool. It'll look terrible if someone picks it up and stares, but that's the effect I'm going for.

## Defeating the Inner Beast

There's a book called Rational Recovery that helped me way more than AA ever did. It talks about an "inner beast"—the critic always telling you you're a failure.

I'm doing this to defeat that beast telling me I'm a terrible miniature painter. And also telling me I should go buy a six-pack right now while everyone's asleep. But that's probably unique to me.

## The Answer Is Always Glaze

If you ever want to make your paint job look better, just glaze it. I can glaze over those highlights and tone it back down—which is exactly what I don't want to do here, so I'm not going to keep glazing.

## 20 Minutes Done

Quick one—13 minutes, probably 15 because I had to stop when I threw the model across the room. But hey, not bad. 20 minutes of painting, got the robe done, and I think it looks pretty good.

Also, this is the last video to comment on for the giveaway. I'll pull the winner tomorrow.
