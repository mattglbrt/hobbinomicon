## Happy Halloween - Monumental Day

I have finished all the robes and clothing on the goblins. That means I only have spears, skin, and faces left. After the robes and clothing, this is going to be a breeze.

The spear tips are quick, the staves get dark lines then contrast paint for fake wood grain. The skin has very little showing since one arm has a shield. The face is going to be pretty quick and fun.

## The Purge Progress

The purge is well underway—I've already sold like $200 worth of stuff. While digging through everything, I found this Shadows of Retribution Gareth list that went 4-1 or maybe even 5-0. I have no desire to paint it, but I'll put it on the table for test games.

## Committing to Warmachine

I've decided to commit to Warmachine. It was a tough tossup with Infinity, but the local Infinity scene's schedule just doesn't work for me. Warmachine is way more feasible. Eventually I'll return to Infinity, but it's just not in the cards with the kids right now.

## A Game a Day

I want to play a game a day—average seven games a week with at least half against real opponents (in person or on War Table online). The rest I'll practice solo.

## The Practice Plan

I'm going to clear this table, set up two Warmachine tables, and practice deployment, turn one, and turn two. That's really where games are lost for me—I brick my deployment or it falls apart by turn two.

I want to unpack the beginning turns against different situations: gunlines, melee alpha strikes, going first vs second. Just practice with real models and move them around.

## The Channel Direction

I'm going to start doing different series:
1. My journey of getting good at Warmachine (I'm very much a scrub right now)
2. Showing what I'm doing to improve

Step one is getting a table cleared after the purge. Then I can spend 45 minutes daily running through turns one and two.

Halloween is crazy with four kids, so this might be the video. Happy Halloween!
