## Transcript

Did some hobby stuff today, mostly on the robes for the goblins. Still not done with them, but I'll talk about that more in a second. The purge is going good. I've gotten about $200 in sales so far. And I feel like most of that was just stuff that was holding space for really no reason, stuff that I've been needing to sell. So I'm doing good with the purge.

Haven't really touched the painting portion though. I got other stuff I've been working on, which I'll show you when it's done. But yeah, I'm proud of what I've gotten done so far. And I feel like the progress is going to keep compounding.

So, what I've been thinking about a lot lately is like what army do I actually want to focus on and play seriously. And I think that I've decided I'm going to focus on Warmachine. I love Infinity. I think Infinity is the best game in the world. But I think Warmachine is the game that I'm going to be able to actually play the most, and I think it's the game that I'm going to be able to get the most competitive in.

I've been playing Shadows of Retribution—or I've been theory crafting Shadows of Retribution. Gareth list is pretty solid. I think it's going to be really good. And I've been just like thinking about how I want to approach getting better at Warmachine.

So my plan is to play a game a day. Not necessarily a full game, but at least like practice something every day. Whether that's deployment practice, whether that's just like running through a turn, whether that's playing a full game on War Table. But I want to do something every day to get better.

And I think the biggest thing that I need to work on is deployment and turn one and turn two. Like I feel like if I can get those down, the rest of the game will come together. So I'm going to start with just deploying and then running through turn one and turn two and seeing where my pieces end up and if that's where I want them to be.

I've been looking at WTC layouts and just trying to understand how to approach different terrains. And I've been printing some SFG terrain to practice with. So I'm going to have like a little practice table set up so I can just run through deployments whenever I have a few minutes.

The thing is, I used to be really competitive. Like I played Magic competitively for a long time. I played Mage Knight competitively. And I miss that. I miss like really trying to get good at something and like seeing that improvement. So I think Warmachine is going to be that for me.

Anyway, that's the update. Happy Halloween, everybody.
