## Finishing the Base

Finishing this thing up finally. I wasn't able to get back down here yesterday. I've got my glue in the busted up palette—don't need that much, just a little bit.

If this was a piece of terrain or a figure that would see a lot of table time, I would cover the whole thing in watered down glue. But for what this is going to do, there's no need to really lock it in like that.

I finished my first pen cartridge of the year, so I'm going to use this as my paintbrush now. I'm just going to sprinkle this around, flatten it out. Any stuff that comes up and gets mixed in is okay—anything on top of this green will suck into it and lock down.

## Testing Cherry Blossom Tufts

I've got some cherry blossom tufts for the Ice King's commission, and I want to put a few on here to test how they work before trying them on his real bases. Just a pinch or two—I don't want to actually use it, just test it out.

This is Huge Miniatures 4-in-one scatter. It's got wood chips and stuff in it—like actual flock consistency mixed with static grass. Very cool. I'll probably build a static grass applicator because the one I have is very old and I don't think it works anymore.

I'm just testing to make sure it soaks up the glue well. Sometimes stuff sucks it up and gets a weird shine or satin finish. But there we go—the pink on the base looks cool.

## Two Models Done

That's two miniatures painted for the year. Looks awesome. Got all the excess knocked off. This one is done-done—someday I'll have a better photo booth.

## When Life Gets Hectic

Today got crazy. I got hit with a bunch of work stuff, had to run errands I wasn't planning on, had to help some people I wasn't planning on helping—which is great. It's cool to have people to help and people that can depend on you.

At first, I was panicking: how am I going to fit everything in the day now? Then I thought, you know what? I'm going to take a breath. I'm going to chill. I'm going to set a timer for 10 minutes. I'm going to paint for 10 minutes. I'm going to get my daily brush on the model.

And then I relaxed. There's no actual problem. I'm going to spend an hour banging out work, go do the things I need to help some people, come back and bang out more work, and get everything else done. It's going to be a great day.

## The Takeaway

I've painted. I'm making a video sharing it with you right now. Hopefully giving you that cool lesson to just take a breath for 10 minutes and it doesn't seem that bad.

I'll see you tomorrow. This was day 118.
