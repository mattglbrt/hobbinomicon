## Rainy Day Projects

Got this cube and another idea for it. Because it tips over due to the face, I'm going to put a weight in it and then put it on a new shelf for rainy day projects.

The idea is for those days where I don't have tons of time to dig into a real project—I can have a small shelf of things I can make meaningful progress on in just 10 minutes. In-progress projects that won't weigh on me or constantly be in the back of my mind. Just cool ideas that won't stress me out.

## Adding Weight

Just cut a little slit in the bottom and stuck a washer on the opposite side from the face to stop it from tipping over. Cut the actual material out rather than making a slit so it wouldn't push out and create a bulge.

## Matching the Board

For the paint, I did dry brush stippling and started working in some greens the same way I did the actual board. Then streaking grime with lighter fluid to wipe it off—same process as the board itself.

## Perfect Match

Now these blend right into the board like pretty spot on. I'm going to let them dry because they're still pretty wet, but they're meant to look like they belong here. Pretty awesome result.
