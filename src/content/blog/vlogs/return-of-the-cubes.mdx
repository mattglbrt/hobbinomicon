## Transcript

Okay, what I'm doing—you're going to have a hard time seeing this, maybe—but I'm taking these leftover pieces that were kind of cast from when I cast some stuff with resin. I'll make a video about that eventually. Just throwing them into the cube to add weight to it so that it doesn't tip.

So, I finally figured this out. This is my little "rainy day projects" shelf. And it's kind of like a quick pick, like 10-minute session. I got a few things I can jump into. I can change the picture on the wall behind me. Maybe pick a poster and frame it, or print a picture, or just I don't know what I'm going to do back there. But this is kind of the "when you have time, pick something off of here and do it" shelf. So, instead of my desk being cluttered with four or five things, I'm going to try to keep it down to one project at a time and I will get that one project from this shelf and put it back on this shelf when I'm done.

But returning to the cubes. I have this one cube done. I'm going to do a little bit more on this one, and then all three cubes will be in good shape. And really, I think these cubes are kind of ugly to be honest, but it's really mostly just practice and learning. Really when I get to these kind of like industrial terrain pieces for the Mòlley Crew board, I kind of want to lean into what it looks like after the game is done. Like some heavy weathering on these, just really grimy. And it's just been fun to figure out how to do that.

So what I'm doing is stippling with a dry brush. These two—I think it's Vallejo greens, but I'm not 100% sure. I'll put it in the description down below and I'll put all the paints I used. But this is the "if my kid was asleep, I would use an airbrush for this" section. And she's not quite asleep yet.

This is called Streaking Grime. So, I've put that all over. And now I have some—this is called lighter fluid. It's got a few uses. So, lighter fluid reactivates the Streaking Grime and makes it kind of streaky and lets it move a little bit. So, I'll use cotton balls or cotton swabs or paper towels. I kind of use everything and then just kind of use the lighter fluid to smudge. Think of it as making a mess and cleaning up your mess over and over again. Just kind of working through it. And it just gives the terrain a nice streaky, dirty, used look to it.

I mean it's not as bright, so it might be hard to see on video, but man I love this. It's coming out exactly like the Mòlley Crew board. It's really stinky down here. I should probably have ventilation, but oh well.
