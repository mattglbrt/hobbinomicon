## Time for the Giveaway

Thanks to all of you for getting me to 100 subs. Pretty cool—never expected to even get that many or this many people commenting.

## How I Picked the Winner

I built my own picker using the YouTube API so it's fair. Grabbed all the comments from all videos, put them in a spreadsheet with one entry per unique person (regardless of how many times you commented), then used a random number picker.

1 through 46... and **congratulations to number 24: Vegas 85!**

Reach out to me at matt@thehobby.com or join my Discord (link in description). I probably should have talked about the Discord months ago.

## Back to Normal

Woke up, came down before the workday. Started working on the browns and leathers using the same concept—Decaying Brownish Decay, then white dots to highlight. Finished the pipe, belt, all that stuff.

The book and pipe smoke are going to be where the bulk of my effort goes on this guy.

## Cleaning Day

Looking around and I don't even know where to start. It's getting too crazy again. I didn't finish cleaning last time and it bit me in the ass.

### The New eBay System

I'm setting up a dedicated eBay area. As I pick stuff up, if it's time to sell, I'm posting it immediately—not waiting or telling myself I'll do it all at once.

Take pictures, post on eBay, then put it somewhere safe until someone buys it. All my other methods haven't worked, so changing it up.

## Mage Knight Boosters

Opened another set of Mighty Boosters. What are the odds I'd get three orcs? But also—this is a competitive dungeon team. If I'd pulled this for my first video, I definitely would have made it through.

These would have been killer picks for Mage Knight Dungeons back in the day.

## Found My Xacto Knife

I was looking for this thing everywhere, driving myself crazy. Almost ready to throw in the towel and buy another one. Forgot I was building models at the shop.

## Almost Got the Table Clear

If you saw the last video, I've almost got a 4x4 clean enough to play on. Just need to put away the paper marbling stuff and Mage Knight collection.

## War Machine Battle Reports Coming

Gonna try it out soon. Probably start with unpainted armies and terrain and slowly build it up—don't want to say I'll wait until everything's painted and then never do it.

## Ultimate Dungeon Terrain: DONE

I'd left the rim unfinished for so long. Couldn't figure out what to do with it. Finally decided to just paint it black like a base rim—and I think I like it.

Got to fix some spots where spray paint drifted through, but the Ultimate Dungeon Terrain tile is finally done.

Thanks for watching. Congratulations again to the winner—make sure you reach out!
