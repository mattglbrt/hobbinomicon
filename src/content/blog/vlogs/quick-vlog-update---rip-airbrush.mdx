## Transcript

Hey everybody, this is going to be a quick one. I wanted to get this Circle Orboros army primed tonight and get a zenithal on it. And tonight is the night that my airbrush decided to die. It's been about a 2 week process of trying to get it working again. And I think at this point it's almost 11 or 12 years old and I think it's just reached its limit that it's going to take for me.

So, I was gonna give up, but then I realized I wouldn't be able to get any hobbying done or get a video out today. And I had this cool new setup finally. I'm going to be able to start doing live streams later this week. So, the big cool part about this video is that Wednesday, 1:00 p.m. Eastern time, I plan on doing my first actual live stream. I think it'll just be more fun with the way that I kind of like to ramble and talk out loud now while I'm painting.

But I also want to talk about just kind of like—I didn't know what to do. I couldn't get the airbrush to work, but I had to figure out a way to get this army primed. I can't rattle can right now. So, I just pulled the needle out of the airbrush, backed it all the way out so that there's no action on the brush, and as soon as I press the button, it's blasting paint. And that's how I got it done. Just pulled that needle out and started blasting.

So, I was able to get everything primed black as you could see here. It looks pretty good. And even by the end of it, the very last figure that I got to, the airbrush had just totally given up. I think at this point it's just probably clogged from what I was doing to it. So, I just put it down, got a brush, and I brush primed the very last model.

But now, we are ready to go into tomorrow. I'll probably rattle can a zenithal on it. And the challenging part is going to be brush painting this entire army now without my airbrush because that was going to be a key part of my workflow on getting everything done. So now this is really going to be interesting and kind of force me out of the box because usually especially with army painting I rely heavily on the airbrush to get things done and get good results. So, I'm really going to have to knock the dust off the brush skills. But, here we go.
