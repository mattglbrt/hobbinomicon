## The Dragon Printed, But...

The dragon printed, which I guess is good since everything else failed. I save all these Amazon boxes so I can just slide the build plate in and let it sit to get as much resin off as possible.

## 3D Printer is 100% Jacked

Honestly, I'm just kind of over 3D printing. I've been printing almost daily for the last 2-3 years now, and I don't know if it's worth it anymore.

## The Real Cost

I printed a ton of models. Definitely got my money's worth. But in terms of time spent, it's like a whole separate hobby.

If you're printing every day, you could be spending 2 hours a day just messing with the printer—not even counting slicing or making files. There's a huge time cost that at this stage of my life, I don't know if it's worth versus just buying models.

## The Honest Assessment

When it's good, it's good. When the print is dialed in, when your settings are dialed in, when you know your resin, even when you're printing the same files over and over again—it's really good.

But as soon as you insert any kind of variability or changes, it's very easy for it to go bad.

## My Conclusion

I've definitely printed over a thousand models. There are tons of cool things that only exist as STLs. But even then, I think it's probably better to know somebody who 3D prints than to do resin printing yourself.

3D printing resin yourself probably just kind of sucks.
