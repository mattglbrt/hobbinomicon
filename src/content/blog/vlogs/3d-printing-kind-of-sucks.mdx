## Transcript

I think the dragon printed, which I guess if everything else was—oh, something else printed back there. So, let's see what we got. I save all these Amazon boxes so I can just—I'll just slide the build plate in there and let it sit and try to get as much of the resin off it as possible.

3D printer is 100% jacked. Honestly, I'm just kind of over 3D printing. I've been 3D printing almost daily for the last 2 or 3 years now, and I—I don't know. I don't know if it's worth it. I mean, I printed a ton of models. I definitely got my money out of it, but in terms of like the amount of time that's spent, it's like a whole separate hobby.

If you're printing every day, you could be spending like—not even counting slicing or making files—like just messing with the printer could be like 2 hours a day. So, there's a huge time cost to it that at this stage of my life, I don't know if it's worth the time investment versus just buying models.

And again, there's a ton of cool things that only exist in STLs. But even then, I think it's probably—it's definitely better to know somebody who's 3D printing. And I think 3D printing resin yourself probably just kind of sucks.

I've definitely printed over a thousand models. Like when it's good, it's good. When the print is dialed in, when your settings are dialed in, when you know your resin, even like when you know your files and you're printing the same files over and over again, it's really good. But as soon as you insert any kind of variability or changes, it's very easy for it to go bad.
