## Random Observations

I really need to make something with this leather. It's very good leather that's been sitting for too long.

## The Metal Collection

Check this out—my first love. I've been trying to collect all the Mage Knight and Chainmail metals over the years. Some I got direct from the sculptors.

I've never painted them because I've always been afraid to. I'm going to include these in my goals for next year—finally paint them and not be afraid anymore. These are painter's edition proofs, some unreleased pieces, RA parts. Really cool stuff.

## 12,000 Points is a Lot

Turns out 12,000 points is a lot in Trench Crusade, so we're going to have to paint more!

## Building Without the Printer

Since the 3D printer is still out of commission, I'm doing this the hard way. I printed a new War Profit already, so the guy I was using becomes my resurrected zealot strength trench pilgrim since he's bigger.

I need to make two more nuns and some pilgrims. Luckily I printed a ton of bases when I first printed them.

## Finding Cool Minis

There's actually a ton of cool minis in my collection. A lot I wanted to use for Forbidden Solomon Warborg. The Bird Song Miniatures ones aren't 3D printed—they're resin cast from Australia. Boris is the sculptor.

Can nuns have pistols? I know they're better in close combat, but a pistol nun seems pretty cool. These flintlock pistols look amazing. But I don't know if I want to paint her grimdark—she's such a cool model. Need to make sure she still matches the rest of the warband.

## The Cross Bearer

This guy carries a cross which is just sick. He has scrolls and I'm going to say he's my musician—the crier, the town crier style. That'll be sick.

## The Organized Toolbox

Check this out! I finally started cleaning this out. Scrubbed out all the drawers. Tools, pens, knives, Scale 75 colors organized. I'm starting to have a place for things to go.

I knew exactly where my superglue was. I knew exactly where my basing material was. That's the power of organization.

## Processing the Models

I popped the first foot off very carefully—these are 3D printed so fragile. I'm cutting the base out with a fresh box cutter blade because if I bust this leg or foot, it's going to be so terrible.

Tomorrow's video will be about painting them!
