## Transcript

I really need to make something with this. This is a lot of leather. That's very good leather that's just been sitting. So, coming soon.

Look, check this out. Not this—this is Warmachine. This is something I'm looking forward to painting. My first love. I have been trying to collect all the metals over the years. So, I've never made like a real attempt at it, but I've been trying to get as many of them like when I see deals and stuff. And some of the stuff I actually got direct from the sculptors, too. But I have never painted them because I've always been afraid to paint them. So, I'm going to probably include these in with my goals for next year to finally paint them. And then these are like—this is one of the proofs originally. Just really cool stuff in here. I think this is a lot of the plastic ones. Some unreleased. I think these are probably R&A parts and stuff. So just going through—here's some of the Painter's Edition Jaconee. So adding these into the list to finally paint and not be afraid of painting them anymore.

So it turns out 12,000 points is a lot of points in Trench Crusade. So we're going to have to paint more. Okay, so since the 3D printer is still out of commission, going to have to do this the hard way. I did print off a cool new War Prophet already, so I've had him waiting to get painted. So, he's our new War Prophet. And then this is who I was using as my War Prophet. This guy will now be our Resurrected Zealot Strength Trench Pilgrim since he's a little bit bigger than everybody. I think I'm gonna have to rebase him. So, we'll keep him out.

All right, bases. Luckily, I think I have some more in here I can use. Hopefully—we're hoping—there's another one. I'm hoping I'll be able to make some nuns. Yeah, okay. I printed off a ton of bases when I printed them. So, I think I'm going to need to make two more nuns and some pilgrims. Hopefully that'll be enough. So, we'll see what I got.

So, there's actually a ton of cool minis in here. A lot of them I wanted to use—I plan on using for Forbidden Psalm Warband. But most of them are like evil looking guys. I've got a couple that I think I can use for Trench Pilgrims, but not quite what I'm looking for in this box.

Also from Westfalia and also I think from Boris. This is from the Elven release they did. I absolutely love the book. Well, I think it's a series, but only the first one's in English, and my German is not that great yet. So—man, these are so cool. I definitely got to add these to the tryhard painting just like most of that last box I had, too.

Can nuns have pistols? I know they're like better in close combat, but a pistol nun seems pretty cool. But if they're in armor, you know, I think this figure is like pretty slim and slender and they have the greatsword and it's kind of like a similar pose as the other nun and that's just a cool model that'd be fun to paint up. And then so I'm thinking those will be my other—my next two nuns.

Maybe that's what it is. There we go. I guess I had it a little bit too close. So if those—and this guy just kind of like he carries this cross which is just sick. So he carries the cross and then he has these scrolls and I'm going to say he's my musician and he's like the crier, the town crier kind of style. I think that'll be sick. So, there's a pilgrim.

Okay, so I just double checked and with what I currently have painted, I just need to paint these—get these four guys ready and I'll be able to make it work. So, going to get these guys built.

Check this out. Let me zoom out some. I finally started cleaning this out. I scrubbed out all the drawers, and now—tools, pens, knives—working on getting all of my Scale 75 colors in here, paints organized. I'm starting to have a place for things to go. So, I actually know my super glue is right here.

All right, so I popped this first foot off very carefully here because these are just 3D printed—so fragile. So, what I'm trying to do—this is a fresh box cutter blade—is I'm cutting the base out, and I'm just going to chunk the base because if I bust this leg or this foot, it's just going to be so terrible. So, there we go.

Okay, I think I got all the supports off. But I'm sure as soon as I wash this back, there's going to be more. These—I think it's the Birdsong Miniatures. They're not 3D printed. These are resin cast that I got from Australia. And I think Boris—I forgot his last name—is the sculptor for these other ones. This one's 3D printed. This one I'll look up. I know I got it on MyMiniFactory, but I'll have to look up where he came from. But it is pretty cool. And he comes in a ton of different parts if you want. But I really just kind of like the way that he comes.

So yeah, I think this is definitely going to be perfectly fine. Battle Nun. And then this one with the pistols—I think I might try to throw a sword or something on her back. Just these flintlock pistols look so cool. But again, I don't know if I want to paint her grimdark. So—this is such a cool model. I mean, they're all cool. They're all really cool, but I just don't know if I want to do this one grimdark. And then I definitely want to make sure it still matches the rest of the warband. So, it's a tough decision.

Okay, I'm going to get these guys primed and then tomorrow's video will be about painting them. But that's it for today. I'll see you tomorrow.
