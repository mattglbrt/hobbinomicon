## Going In Completely Blind

I think with the way the world works, it's really hard to go into something like a game blind. It's very hard to not just look up reviews before you buy something.

Today I'm sharing me going completely blind into Kingdom Death. I originally bought it for the miniatures—I didn't have any plans of actually playing it. So I didn't look at gameplay, didn't look at anything else in the box. Just thought "those look like very cool miniatures to paint."

## Building the Miniatures

### The Survivors

The survivors were awesome to build. High quality models, very cool sculpts—10 out of 10 on the figures themselves.

If you're a modeler though, be aware:
- There are some gaps that need filling
- I had to use a ton of sprue goo and resin glue to cover mold lines
- Plan for 2-3 hours if you want to really gap fill
- About an hour if you just want to throw them together

The two-part bases are pretty cool—you can pop in an insert of faces (not skulls) which is a nice touch.

### The White Lion

The lion had more challenging gaps, particularly on the wrists and back. I used Tamiya resin glue for gap filling throughout.

## What's In The Box

This is the box—everything except the miniature parts. It's a very thick, very high quality box.

I've organized everything:
- Sleeved all the cards
- Used coin protector pages for tokens (fit perfectly)
- Put everything in a binder system
- Used the included hard card dividers

There's a LOT of components. They come with dividers for the different boss fights, settlement cards, gear, and more. The spaces originally designed for coins don't quite fit once you add trackers.

## Table Space Requirements

My desk is 5 feet across and 30 inches deep—a big craft desk. I can tell you right now this game won't fit on it.

**What you actually need:**
- About 45-46 inches wide (not including rulebook space)
- About 32 inches deep
- A 4x4 Warmachine table works perfectly
- A 6x4 definitely works

I'm going to have to move this to my gaming table.

## Setup Observations

- Uses cards for monster AI
- Characters start 6 spaces away from the monster
- Movement is cardinal directions only (no diagonals)—makes the game simpler
- The first encounter has specific cards that go on top of the shuffled decks
- Once I knew what I was doing, setup only took about 10 minutes

## My Opening Strategy

I haven't read ahead and don't really know how combat works, but I didn't want to put all my eggs in one basket. My gut tells me to split the party up and maybe divide and conquer.

This could be a terrible mistake. I don't know what's better, but I'm going in blind, so we'll see.
