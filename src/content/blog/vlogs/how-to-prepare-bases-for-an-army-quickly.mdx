## The Least Glamorous Hobby Days

Sometimes the most productive hobby days are the least glamorous. This is a couple hours of afternoon work—got all the bases ready for the orcs and goblins.

## The Technique

Using that basing material we made a couple days ago with a palette knife:

1. Come in, kind of slopping it on
2. Be firm but gentle—don't push it all the way to the base
3. That way you still get natural texture without obvious knife strokes

## The Cleanup Trick

Have a bucket of water to dip your hand in and wipe off the old material. Then quickly clean off the side of the base with your finger.

If you take time to use paper towels, it's going to take forever AND waste paper towels. Just use your finger, wipe it off, done.

## The Results

Did all these bases in about two hours. That brings our total to about 250 bases, and we've only used half of one jar.

## The Recipe Reminder

- Old coffee grounds (dried out, cooked in oven)
- Two parts material
- Two parts spackle
- One part paint

Tomorrow: starting the goblin factory!
