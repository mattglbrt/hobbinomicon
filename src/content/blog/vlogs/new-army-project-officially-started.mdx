## Transcript

Today I started working on the new Frozen and Forgotten set from Steamforged Games for Warmachine. This is the new Warcaster, Lanyssa. I think I'm saying that right.

This model is in nine parts, which at first I was like, "Oh man, how am I going to do—or why is this nine parts?" But it was actually really fun to put together. The mold lines were very easy to pick off.

And with these, the way that Steamforged does them, you just go in the order. So, A1, A2, A3, and then so on. You just move through all the sprues with no directions really needed, which is actually pretty cool.

And I think I do actually really appreciate how they did this in so many parts because it's a really cool model. I'm really excited to get this painted.

And just look through these other sprues real quick. You can see pretty much everything is in like all these multiple parts, which again, at first I was like, why is it like that? But I think it's a lot of fun to build. So, I'm pretty excited to dig into these.

Hoping to get the rest of them done tomorrow. But for the vlog today, just got her built. Cannot wait to get her painted.
