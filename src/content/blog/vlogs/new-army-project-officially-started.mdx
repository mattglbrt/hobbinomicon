## The Dusk Army Begins

It's official—I'm starting a new Warmachine army. Dusk has been calling to me for a while now, and I finally pulled the trigger on the Frozen and Forgotten battlegroup.

## What's in the Box

The Frozen and Forgotten set gives you a solid starting point for a Dusk force. Great models with that signature aesthetic that drew me to the faction in the first place.

## The Painting Plan

I'm still working out exactly how I want to approach painting these. The faction has a very specific look, and I want to do it justice while also making it my own.

## Getting Organized

Part of starting a new army project is getting everything organized—sprues sorted, build order planned out, painting scheme decided. Laying that groundwork now will make the whole process smoother.

## Looking Forward

Excited to dive into this project. It's been a while since I started a completely new army from scratch, and there's something energizing about that fresh start feeling.
