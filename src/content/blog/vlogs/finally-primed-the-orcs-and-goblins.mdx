## Morning Success

Successful print in clear resin—got the wings and returning the Ice King's airbrush. Strapped into the minivan, we're happy.

## New Airbrush Day

The day is here! Our next permanent airbrush—the Creos 771. Pretty much on par with high-end Iwatas.

Hard plastic case, putting on my speed release valve. Definitely the nicest airbrush I've ever used. Feels amazing in hand, best trigger I've ever felt. Huge improvement over my previous Iwata.

## The Priming Marathon

Not priming on sticks—priming each individual model. Not the most efficient time-wise, but great practice with this airbrush.

After an hour and a half, extremely happy with it. Clogged once at 90 models—took exactly 3 minutes to unclog. Popped the outer nozzle off, saw the clog, got it out. Pretty amazing.

What you're seeing is actually half of what I primed. Secret project is a whole other thing.

## Also Primed

Got the rest of Molly Crews printed and primed. Had printed these before but dropped them down the stairs—shattered because 3D printed. My fault, not the models.

## The Week Ahead

It's 11:45 PM, 16 minutes to get this posted. Tomorrow I want all the airbrush work done for at least the goblins, hopefully the orcs. That's 20+ models—the whole army ideally.

We've got 10 days to get the whole army done because the airbrush issues created a big snag. Sunday the 26th is a Warmachine event, so I need something painted for that too.

Finally firing on all cylinders again. Tomorrow: crazy painting non-stop all day!
