## Upstairs Painting Session

Got to apologize in advance for the potato quality on this one. I'm upstairs, recently reading Unleash to get some ideas for the RPG campaign.

## The Glazing Process

I'm working my way up through the Scale Color six-pack. Base coated it with that Prussian Blue. You can see I've started just glazing in the next color up.

The process: keep mixing a little bit of the next brightest color in with the previous color. What you're about to see is about 20 minutes of glazes to get to this point—which you probably barely even notice.

## The Struggle with Fabric

Cloaks and fabrics really kick my butt. Normally I would just airbrush these, but since I'm really trying to make an effort of getting better, I'm taking the time to really glaze this in.

## Working Through It

I'm at the kitchen table. All the kids are sick, I'm a little bit sick. Just trying to get some painting in real fast when I can.

For the highest highlight, I take that lightest color and start mixing it in with the midtone—that's what that streak is. Then just keep glazing it in.

And this is what I ended up with.
