## Transcript

Okay, got to apologize in advance for the potato quality on this one. I'm upstairs. Was recently reading Unleashed to get some ideas for the RPG campaign. And I'm just going to be working my way up through the Scale Color six-pack. Base coated it with that Prussian Blue. And you can see I've started just glazing in that next color, the next step up. And now I'm just working all the way up through this palette with glazes. So, I just keep mixing a little bit of the next brightest color in with the previous color.

And what you're about to see is about 20 minutes of glazes to get to this point, which you probably barely even notice. And cloaks and fabrics really just kick my butt. So, normally I would just airbrush these, but since I'm really trying to make an effort of getting better, I'm just taking the time to really glaze this in and just working my way up through.

So, what I'm doing here, I'm going to take this highest highlight or lightest highlight and start mixing it in with that midtone. And that's what that streak I just pointed to. And now I'm just going to start glazing this in and just—I'm at the kitchen table as I expected or as I suspected. All the kids are sick. I'm a little bit sick. So just trying to get some painting in real fast when I can. And this is what I ended up with.
