## Morning Painting Progress

I wanted to paint every day, and I figured if I just have a model on my desk that I can put five or ten minutes on before starting work, I can accomplish that.

I dry brushed the fur again—mixed Charming Chartreuse with Vanilla Yellow and dry brushed the body, did a bit more on the foot, let it dry, then hit it again with Charming Chartreuse. Now I have a lot more color separation between the fur and body.

I mixed some of that pink with the same Vanilla White and highlighted the top. For the face, I noticed there were little tepees there, so I went over it with two colors. I also put a dot of white paint in that empty eye socket—really added so much to the face. Glazed a little Charming Chartreuse on the nose and chin, and hit two edge highlights on the back of that pink wrap.

## The Giveaway

This is the giveaway: a Myalore Warband, Dark Fang Chaos Sorcerer Lord from the Commemorative series, still sealed in shrink. This was the Warhammer Plus one-year subscription model from the first year. Pretty cool, hopefully pretty rare find.

**How to Enter:** If you've ever commented on any video ever, you're already entered. I'll use a tool that grabs comments and announce the winner on Wednesday the 14th. I'll ship it out Friday the 16th.

## Setting Goals for the Year

Today is all about goals—channel, hobby life, professional life, personal life. I've always been big on planning from the business side, and that bleeds over into the personal side. For me, there's no business/personal—it's just the life I want to live. I don't distinguish between work and play. It's all just play, hopefully.

### The Analog Method

There's tons of digital ways to do this, but I like to keep it analog. I've tried all the digital tools and learned there's a lot of power in a pen. I trade the sacrifice in productivity for intention and actually getting things done.

I'm using a Tactile Turn pen I've been carrying every day for two years. I got it to mark two years of sobriety—look at the patina on that brass.

### The System

I write out goals for 10 years, 5 years, 2 years, 1 year, and 90 days. This methodology is from a book called *Scaling Up* by Vern Harnish.

That 10-year goal—they call it a Big Hairy Audacious Goal—should be something so crazy it seems impossible. For me, that's a successful miniature company.

You start at 10 and work your way down. All your goals should build towards those bigger ones. By the time I get to 90 days, I have 10 or 11 major goals—the immediate things that build towards one year, two years, five years, ten years.

## The Project Inventory

I went through all the nooks and crannies of my office, all my shelves, all my piles of junk. It's insane to look at. Most of it I already own, with a very small amount I'd like to trade for—a lot of Lord of the Rings stuff.

### The Lord of the Rings Tangent

It's funny—when you're a kid, you read Lord of the Rings and love it. Then you go through that middle period of "oh yeah, grimdark, no good guys, everything's a gray area." Now that I'm older (I'm 35) and especially with kids, I realize things actually aren't gray. There is a hard right and hard wrong. Usually if something is gray, it's you trying to justify the wrong. I've gone full circle back to loving Lord of the Rings.

## The Keep/Sell List

### Warmachine Keeps
- **Crucible Guard**: Right in the middle of painting

- **Retribution of Scyrah**: Love the models, unique aesthetic, but not excited about playing them
- **Dusk and Phantom of Nero**: Definite keeps
- **Fifth Division**: Almost done, definite keep
- **Armored Core**: Done—only had to paint four or five models

### Warmachine Sells
- **Cryx**: On the fence—want to keep the pirate ship and Raera for RPGs
- **Chimera**: Selling (keeping Belly Ghoul as a mercenary)
- **Primal Bloods**: Selling
- **Rogue Guard**: Selling
- **Grimkin**: Already started selling

### Old World
- **Orcs and Goblins**: Keeping

- **Relic Blade**: Keeping—huge fan, haven't painted it yet
- **Middle-earth**: A ton to paint

## The Big Giveaway Tease

If you're still hanging out at the very end of this long rambling video: I'm probably going to give away the whole Crucible Guard army once I finish painting it. If we get something crazy like a thousand subs, I'll give away the entire painted Crucible Guard army at the end of the season.

That's pie-in-the-sky goal territory, but I plan on fully painting it because it's fun. I'll probably play it too—definitely see some table time.

## The Competitive Speculation

I'm torn between Crucible Guard, Fifth Division, Armored Core, and maybe Gareth for what I'm going to play this year. If they leave legacy alone like they did last year, legacy armies will be in a really good spot. Gareth has a ton of 12-16 inch shooting range that could be pretty crazy.

We'll see how it shakes out. For now, I'm not going to really play in February—just finish Crucible Guard because I want to finish painting it and getting it all painted.

Thanks for watching. Another model painted. Got my goal set. Feeling really good about today. See you tomorrow.
