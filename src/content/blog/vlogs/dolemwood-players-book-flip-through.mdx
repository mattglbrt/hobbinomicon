## Transcript

Hey, hi, hobby Vlog, day 92. Today we're gonna open up the Dolmenwood Player's Handbook. I'm gonna run you through the races and the classes so you can see 'em all. And then I'm gonna build out one of the characters that we made last night. There's probably gonna be a midnight upload, so I don't think I'll be able to do all of the party, but we're at least gonna get one in tonight.

This is the cloth version. It's very vibrant. I hope it, I'm doing a good job at capturing it. The colors on this are awesome. It's thicker than I thought it was in the unboxing. Now that I finally have it out here, this thing is awesome.

It's beautiful. So I printed off some official sheets. I think in retrospect I would've liked to have printed these smaller just because I like a booklet style and I think I'll probably in the future be binding my own character booklets. I can just see that coming, especially as time goes on.

But there's two, two pretty cool sheets. I love the art and the margins. Those are our sheets. Let me make sure I've got you in frame. I didn't realize how terrible my camera angle was last night, but I have a new setup right now. I built one out earlier today.

I wanna make sure we're good. Hey, how about that? I think we're in there. How do we look? Okay, so Dolmenwood player's book. Beautiful. Amazing, lovely art. If you don't know anything about Dolmenwood. Let me tell you everything you ever heard about the what is true and everything you ever heard is false.

Dreams and fairies walk between standing stones and dancing trees slipping in and out of the mortal world as easily as you or I slip through an open door. It's pretty though, dare I say, beautiful. Even all manner of enchantment lingers beneath its bowels. It'll capture your heart if you let it. And that sounds as lovely as a song until you realize the wood will never, ever give it back without paying the proper cost.

Ogham, Tweed, bartender. So a Dolmenwood is very heavily inspired. This is like the Appendix N for Dolmenwood right here. I'm not gonna read everything to you, but things like the Fellowship of the Ring, the Goblin market, Gorman Gast, Jonathan Strange, and Mr. Nor the King of El Oakland's daughter, one of the classics.

Any other cool ones? Film-wise? The Green Knight. I'm gonna need to watch that. I haven't seen that. Princess Manchi. Legend Labyrinth Spirited Away. The original Wicker Man, I believe. Also Jonathan Strange and Mr. Monroe, the television show over the Garden Wall. Such an awesome show and Twin Peaks.

So a little bit of intrigue and mystery, and then horror mixed in. So here we go. The journey begins. This is from Gavin Norman. This is essentially a rule set built upon OSE, which is built upon. Old school Dungeons and Dragons. At this point, it's a mix of the early editions, a little mix of beginner and expert and I think maybe even a little bit of advanced creeping in at this point.

So there's also the campaign book, the Monster Book and Adventure Scenarios. And also I got the character sheets for free from Dolmenwood.com. We're gonna get into it. We'll see. We'll make our character. We've already rolled our stats last video actually. We rolled our stats on our very first unboxing video.

So we're gonna roll up our cleric. The only thing weird is his kindred is gonna be a dwarf just because he's a character that I love and I've been wanting to play that figure. But we will still, I'll still show you all the races and walk you through them. So folk in factions, there's breal.

These are goat men, goat women, goat people. They are not like the beast of chaos that you may be familiar with. They've divided themselves into two casts, a single by the links of their horns, aristocratic longhorns and commoner shorthorns moss slings. These are little. Hobbits people part mortal, flesh and part plant or fungus.

Very cool. There's fairies and demi fe. I think those speak for themselves. And then there's also other sentient beings and also other playable races. So there's a ton of factions. Dolmenwood is extremely. Fleshed out in terms of the game world. I don't wanna read all of these to you, but just know that this is not just a simple rule book, this is a whole campaign system.

This is a whole living world hex map style that you're dropping into. And in my opinion, this will be what role-playing games are compared to going forward. This is setting the new bar of what a tabletop role playing game. Is what the world building is, what supplements are. This is truly a magnum opus.

Truly a masterpiece, truly a great work. Again, different factions, different areas starting play. It comes with a basic play example. I always like in rule books when they actually give you. An idea of what it looks like. They don't take for granted that you're already playing games like this and you just purchased this.

I think that's really cool. I'm gonna try to edit out all my scuffles. Fighting and stuff, you knows again if you're familiar with role playing games, you probably know this stuff, but it's really cool to have this all up front. The pages are tabbed on the side, so you can see it.

There's. Very thought, very solid. I was gonna say thick and solid at the same time. Very good. Ribbon bookmark. Any of these boxes are callouts for the rules. This here, it walks you through the actual rules of playing the game. If you've played OSC, you know the rules. There's experience points, there's probabilities, there's hit points.

I haven't actually rolled hit points yet. There's damage, healing, gaining levels. This uses Ascending Armor class. Like I said I've done my best to not spoil it, but I should probably know that one. We'll find out once we start building, and again, this explains what all the attributes and all of the secondary attributes do.

Here's an example of Monster Statistics. Anytime you see one of these boxes, that's just gonna be something helpful. All right, here we go. Creating a character. So role ability scores. Oh, some of our characters were subpar, but we're gonna let him ride. One of them we fixed already 'cause he was just so bad.

But we've had to fix his intellect, I feel, and I even feel bad about that. I almost didn't do it, but I love that figure. I've had that figure for 20 years and that he's not gonna be a simple 10. So we cheated for him, but that's how it goes. All right. We rolled ability scores 3D six in turn, strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, and charisma.

Oh, that's what we did. We went. 3D six down the line. 'cause we're not cowards. Choose a kindred. We will choose. We've already chosen those. So there are some class restrictions here. Elves, alkins, wood grooves cannot be clerics or friars because they have no spiritual connection to the deities of mortals.

There's a very well thought out religion, spirituality system in this game. I do know that. So next we'll choose our class. I should probably grab a pencil. I'm not usually a pencil guy, but when I am a graph gear 500 is one of my favorites. So here we go back in it using our handy dandy notebook.

So I'm gonna fill out our name. This historic dust corn. I guess I should move it too. You don't really care about my care sheet. You probably care about the book more. Lord dusk warn, he and doves are not in. Doman would. So it's gonna be very interesting people's reaction to seeing him in the game world.

He is going to be dwarf cleric, but we'll wait till we get there. So then we adjust ability scores. You can lower non probability scores for every two points by which an ability score is lowered. One point can be added to a probability. I did not know that. So that's cool. That makes me feel better about being a little cheating mc cheater face.

So we know that we rolled up four intelligence. For our soon to be Ranger. So I will make that up for, by subtracting some stats elsewhere for sure. If there's ability modifiers, there's kindred and class traits. You record all of those. You record languages, skill and save targets.

Here's a summary of classes. This is probably what you're looking for. Bards and CLA or Bard Probability is charisma and dexterity. 1D six hit points. He is semi marshal combat aptitude. I really like how instead of saying specific weapons they can or can't use it's this group. So your Marshall, non Marshall, semi marshal.

Very cool. Main class capabilities. I love this chart. You can just look in and see what it does. So the bard has counter charm, enchantment decipher script, a folklore, a cleric gets holy magic from level two onward. A holy order can turn. Undead and channelers have glamors fairy ruins, which are very powerful.

Detect magic, use arc can items. The fighter gets really cool combat talents. It's really expanded upon just a dude who swings his weapons around. The friar has herbalism. There is a very robust. Like herb and fungus and like a chemical system to this. I believe that was one of the main poles for me personally.

They also learned holy magic. They learn turn undead. They're non Marshall. There's the hunter. He gets the animal companion alertness, tracking missile attacks. The night horsemanship, monster slayer strength of will the magician. Arcane magic. Detect magic. And this is an actual useful thief class with the back stab climbing.

The storming traps. Picking locks. Oh, and decipher script. I almost missed that one. So for hit points, you you have a minimum of one, regardless of your constitution, but you determine it by rolling your hit point, dying and adding your Constitution modifier. There's an optional rule of re-rolling ones or twos not gonna do that.

We're gonna take what we're given. Because that's how we like it. One thing that I do think is really cool about this is you roll your equipment. Everybody gets common clothes, a backpack containing rations, a water scan, a Tinder box about pouch getting 3D six gold pieces. The class items are determined on a class by class basis, and then there's some adventuring items where you can either pick from this list here or you can roll them.

There's not, it's not like a super mid maxi buying kind of thing. It's like set kits with a little bit of customization, which I like because I'm somebody who could spend all day trying to figure out what I'm gonna buy, what I'm gonna kit out. I just I like this 'cause it limits me in meaningful ways, but also has that customization.

There is an optional rule. If you want to actually do the that thing, each character gets 3D, six times 10 gold pieces to purchase armor, weapons and equipment. So you don't have to take the kits if you don't want to go that route, which is also very cool Armor class. This is the question that I could not remember.

Your character's armor class is determined by their armor plus their dexterity modifier. Some kindreds and classes also grant a bonus to ac unarmed ac.

If your character has no armor, their AC is 10 plus dexterity. Modifier speed alignment. I thought I was gonna tell us if we were at echo or not. Note on mobile and XP name and details. There we go. All right. We've rolled. This is, it shows an example of actually making a character, which is great.

Just walking through. It's always good to see real examples, especially if you don't really know what's going on. There's some ability score. So I'm gonna write down any modifiers we have. So our strength on this guy is 11, so that's a no modifier. Intelligence of seven is minus one. He's a little dopey.

Two, his wisdom is 17, so that's plus two. His dexterity is plus one. His constitution is 14, so plus one, his charisma is six, so he's minus one there. I think maybe we will maybe we'll drop his dexterity down to get his intelligence up to nine. Actually, no we'll leave him how he is. I don't wanna do that too much.

We're not gonna, I'm resisting the urge to min max. He's got seven intelligence, a little bit dopey. All right. Ability checks. Prime abilities these kind of work. If your probability is higher, you get XP modifiers, which I think is pretty cool. And I need to know, do I need to write that down in my sheet somewhere?

Oh, yes, I do. When we get to the classes, I'll record that. This is an explanation of all the stats here won't get into those. And also, I think most of this part, I think the Doman Wood Getting Started guide is free. Okay. Yeah. So I'll just, if you go to necrotic gnome.com, there is a welcome document called Welcome to Doman Wood, which I think does cover a lot of the character creation.

And again I don't want to, I'm not gonna read everything. So here we start off with.

Les or no, actually this is languages. So all the different languages. All right, here we go. The kindreds. So there is a couple of things. There is mortality. There's aging there. There's a calendar system to this game that is very important and plays a rather large role. There's no innate magic except for a few individuals gifted with sensitivity.

Mortal Kindreds have no innate magic, and the majority of mortal folk are mistrustful of magic. Religion and worldview is rather large. They're governed by the laws of times and nature. Mortals tend to be social banning together for safety and cooperation. Townsend, villages of mortal folk in Dolmenwood act as a respite from the dangers of the wild.

So they're the fairy. There's fairy classes. They are innately magic. They have their own religions, their own mindsets. There's the Demi Fe I wanna read. Don't wanna spill all the sauce here. So we're just gonna get right into the classes. So Breal, these are the goat people.

They have their own religion. They normally adhere into the plein church, which is the main religious body. In Dolmenwood, they have class suggestions. They're most commonly fighters. Knights are magicians and they seldom seek membership of the chlorine church as clerics or friars. And only rare individuals have enough of a connection with the fairy to become enchanter.

So there's information about how they'll look. Advancement. There's name generators. There's bro backgrounds, trinkets. You can even generate a character's appearance in these tables, which is very cool. So the elf, we're gonna run an elf ourself. They appear human-like, but other worldly, I like that. Names, details.

Elves are commonly enchanters fighters, hunters, or magicians. It's rare for an elf to be accepted into the Dolmenwood nobility as a knight. Elves cannot be clerics or friars. Here's all the same thing. Backgrounds, appearance, generators, alkin, the little cats. It's cool in that there's different appearances, just like how the ger malkin's normal form is that of a humanoid cat wearing clothing, speaking and walking upright.

It is by all appearances. A humanoid cat, beautiful or ugly, with fur covering their little body. They also have a fat muggy form called the Chester. A alkin resembles a normal cat, though perhaps fatter than the average mouser. A Alkin and Chester can understand language, but can only respond in a wordless, YOWs, and meows.

They're shapeshifters I missed that part at the beginning. So they can choose between these forms as part of their rules. And then there's a Faye Predator form. In Wilder, that's the name of this form, is difficult to perceive clearly in the mortal world as more than a gleaming pair of deranged predatory eyes beyond the throw of the lanterns light.

Very cool. Very Alice in Wonderland vibes. So shape shifting. They can go into Chester Unlimited usage where they can only pop into wilder once a day. Very cool. It's gonna be fun to paint up those kind of effects. And here's a good representation. Of the three of them, the one hiding in the bushes. This one's spinning his pocket watch.

Definitely gonna be doing some more of them in the future. Humans are humans wandering Ls, occasionally trist with humans. Our el character's name is Tris. It's funny spelled differently though. Of course. That's still so cool. Here's our human tables now. Mos slings. I love moss slings.

I have moss slings queued up in the all. And the true straight to dome wood party that we do after this party. I love these guys. Very interested and intrigued by the moss slings. Love this guy. I think he's the dome wood figure that you get wood. Gus I love these guys too. I have a not a bunch, but I have some wood Gus 3D printed.

They do, they have a different, yeah, I have this specific guy, 3D printed at that exact pose. So they are capricious bat faced goblins. Very cool. I forgot to read you guys the classes. Don't worry. I'm still trying to learn how to be a good YouTuber. Humans grow malkin adventurers are commonly barged in Chandler hunters or thieves.

It's rare for them to be accepted into nobility as a knight, and they cannot be clerics or friars. Humans are commonly found in all classes except enc. Shanter rare is a human with enough connection to ferry to become an enchanter. The MOS slings are commonly fighters and hunters, and they're only occasionally accepted into the nobility as knights, and they seldom seek membership of the plural time church, and rarely possess enough connection to ferry to become enchanters.

They have their own kind of magic, which is called kns and mos skills. Very cool. Wood grooves are commonly bards magicians or thieves. Rare to be a knight. Cannot be clerics or fryers. There's a definitely a theme running there. And of course, all those are if you don't wanna follow that, you don't have to.

Okay, here we go. This is what we've been looking for. The bard has a lot of cool skills. Again, I don't wanna spoil everything. I don't wanna give it all away. Definitely go by wood. It's awesome. But here we go. Here's the cleric. So their prim ability is wisdom, so I'm just gonna. Put a little star there.

His hit points is 1D six per level. So let's roll those hit points. I'll use our goldwood dice for this part,

but if you watched our other video, you definitely could roll one of his planetary influences that we established, which I will mark on his character sheet a little bit later. Okay. Let me fill my scores in. I didn't actually write them on the sheet. 11 0 7 minus one. Wisdom 17. Dexterity 13.

Constitution is 14 and charisma is six. All right, so we're rolling this Constitution bonus with a plus one. So actually use a dice tray this time.

Here we go.

It rolls out, but I'll take a five. So our hit points, we have six hp, max, HP is six. That's a good role. Maybe he'll be our tank 'cause we know we're gonna need it based on everybody else's stats. So next his armor. Any including shields except arcane or fairy magic and weapons. Any except arcane. That's another thing I like because our figure is modeled with a sword and shield.

Which is sometimes a hard combination for a cleric to have. As servants of the church, they must be lawful or neutral. He's gonna come in neutral because again, he's not from Dolmenwood proper and maybe he's gonna have to be initiated into the ways of Dolmenwood. 'cause right now he's an apostate.

He's turned his back on, on the gods of his land and he's walking around really. Trying to find the power within himself, and he doesn't really know what he's doing. So maybe he comes into Doman wood and he learns about the powers and the deities here. All right. Alignment, falling from grace. They must be faithful to tenets of their order.

A cleric who transgresses or becomes chaotic falls from grace and loses the ability to pray for spells. Only mortals are trained as clerics magical armaments. Clerics are forbidden to use magic weapons, armors and shields of arcane or fairy origin. They may only use holy magic armaments. Very cool.

Flavorful. So this is the equipment things I was talking about because we can roll 1D six, but we already know he's gonna have chain, mail and shield. We don't want to cheat it too hard, but that's just what the figure is modeled with. So he has chain, mail and shield, which we'll write down, and then he has a long sword as well.

And he also, he has a holy symbol so he can detect magic items. We'll fill all this out on the sheet. I won't make you guys watch me do all that part. Holy magic. I don't think he gets holy magic. On level one. Yeah. Spell casting. Once he's proven their devotion, which happens on level two, so we're gonna try to still follow as much with Dolmenwood Lord as we can.

So he is not gonna walk into Dolmenwood with spells who won't get them until level two. So we're gonna have to play through that first adventure to get anything holy order again, we will pick the holy order upon reaching level two. It's almost like it was meant for us to have a dwarf, not from Dolmenwoods, so we can get him in there before we have to make all these decisions.

And I wonder what he's gonna run into. To help him do that. There is turning undead, there's different advancement tables per class right now. Our prime requisite. Our prime requisite is wisdom. So now we can turn back in to the character advancement table back here. Okay.

Prime xp, our score is a 17 in wisdom, so we're actually gonna get a plus 10% ability or experience modifier. So he's currently level one. His modifier is 10% and he needs 1,500 XP to get to the next level. That part I will write down. Current XP is zero. And that's it. All the classes just are one page spread and then all of the spells are, so the holy spells are on page a hundred, the back of the book.

I'll show you a couple of them. I don't wanna again, I don't wanna just give it all away. Yeah. I think you're getting a pretty good idea of what you're in for. There's clerical tenets that you'll have to pick once we get to that point. The evangelism. Hierarchy, monotheism, sanctity of life.

I think he's probably gonna go sanctity of life just because the other stuff he doesn't really vibe with. The enchanter, they use fairy runes to cast. That's the form of magic here.

Fighters the cool thing, they get these combat talents. So battle rage, cleave defender, last stand. They get them at 2, 6, 10, and 14. You can roll or choose. There's eight different ones. Very awesome art. It's funny how like the fighters paired down rules wise. So he gets this big one and a half page spread of art, the fryer.

Very cool. I love this art. This guy is also one of the Dolan wood figures. You get holy magic and herbalism the hunter. Hunter gets an animal companion, he gets missile attacks. There's trophies, there's wayfinding tracking. The night. He lives up to a silverwood code. There's horsemanship, there's knighthood, there's different houses that you'll need to be pledged to.

This is way more than just a guy in armor. There's a lot of flavor, a lot of story here. The magician. So the magician is a little bit different than the enchanter and where the Enchanter uses those run, which are items they're, and they're much more powerful from what I've understood of the game than some of the spells are.

But this is their traditional magician who's gonna have access to arcane magic than the thief. The thief has different skills, and I think there's also common skills across all. All characters. So there's listen, search and survival skills that all characters have, and it's that the D six target. So a skill begins at six and then I believe you try to roll under what your skill is, or you have to roll over what your skill is to be successful.

If I remember correctly. Yeah, those are skill targets. So you gotta hit your target to roll over. So here's the magic. Again I'll briefly look through some of the magic so you can get an idea of the type of magic that you have. But I don't wanna I don't wanna get too into the weeds. So there's ranks instead of levels, which I think is cool.

This makes it easier. Some example spells in rank one are fairy servant firelight, ignite extinguish. Vapor of a dream ventriloquism. Then in rank two there's dweller light, perceive the invisible a lot. A lot of spells are named like n lore titles and here's the actual spells and what they're gonna do.

Let's flip through these. I wanted to get to the holy spells. Because I think it's here where there's Associated Saints and there's a name of prayer. So it's not just like I cast detect evil. It's, I will say, the St. Whit's vision. All the spells have prayer names for the holy Magic, so I just think that's really cool.

It's very flavorful to like actually have the benediction that you're doing. And it's not just lightning bolt. So here's all the spell descriptions. And then after we move from spell descriptions, it's the equipment, services and animals. Very cool. Lots of cool stuff in here to dig through.

And I think after I make all my characters I'll come back in. There's lodging and food. There's fungi and herbs. There's tobacco I think it's called maybe something different from tobacco. There's this whole aspect. Yeah, there's alchemy, there's animal trainers, there's specialist services, retainers going out and actually adventuring.

There's more examples of play. There's more examples of prep. Encumbrance is important. It uses slot encumbrance, but it also has rules for weight. Encumbrance. I personally really like slot. I don't wanna have to mess around with weight. Lamentations of the Flame Princess really made me a huge fan of slot encumbrance.

I guess I need to figure out, look at the rules enough to see. And there's camping rules, religion, there's a bunch of religion. Alright, huge thanks for the patron backers. I almost forgot. So if you do want to just run the races as classes, they're in the very back here which is cool. I like to have races and classes separate, but there's also a description of the mobile houses.

So I think this is a pretty good, oh, here's an example of combat. Let's see, of the Elf Knight stat block, they have an armor class of 17. The Knight attempts to Perry, but it's taken aback and you slam into his side. Okay, so it is Ascending armor class answers that question. Alright there we go.

Thank you for watching. This is probably a long one, but if you're interested in Dolmenwood, I think that's a pretty good. Glimpse into it. As we play, I don't plan on doing flip throughs of the campaign book or the monster book. You'll see those as I'm playing through the game. I don't wanna spoil that for myself.

But again, thank you for being here. Thanks for being awesome. Thank you guys for the support. I'm gonna wrap this up. I'm gonna edit it, get it published, and I'll see you tomorrow.
