## The Inspiration

Making a YouTube short inspired by another creator. Had this conversion on my mind for weeks. While waiting for my new airbrush, going to get started.

## The Build

Already had all the parts, so popping the heads off.

At this exact moment, I realized the inspiration just used the full left and right leg of the Ogryn kit. But I made it work—chunked out the middle of the robe and fit it in.

## The Techniques

- Cleaning up mold lines
- Used green stuff for the helmet
- Using the back of the X-acto knife to blend the green stuff into the fur—easy peasy
- Different shoulder pads with the nub marks cleaned off

I'll come back and fix that glove later.

## The Result

About two hours of work condensed into two minutes. Pretty happy with it.
