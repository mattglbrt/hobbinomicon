## Transcript

Today we're going to try making our YouTube short inspired by this gentleman. I'm not going to try to pronounce that name, but I'm going to put the link in the description. I have had these on my mind for weeks. So, while I'm waiting for my new airbrush to come in, going to go ahead and get started.

I had all the parts already, so popping the heads off. At this exact moment, I realized that he just used the full left and right leg of that Flagellant kit, but I made it work. I just chunked out the middle of that robe, fit it in. Here just cleaning up some mold lines, and I used green stuff for the helmet. And I'm just using the back of the X-Acto knife to blend it out into the fur. Easy peasy.

I'm going to do some different shoulder pads. But I'm just getting that nub mark off. And I'll also come back and fix that glove. But here we go. This is about two hours of work condensed into two minutes.

Oh, and here you can just see that I blended in the front of the fur. Same thing. It's using the back of that knife. But here's where we ended up. Pretty happy with it.
