## Back After the Doctor

I'm back. Got oxygen and a steroid shot yesterday. I think I'm as good as I'm going to be until everything gets out. But we're going to vibe out with drybrushing—golden flesh, raw umber, earth green, vanilla yellow.

## The Color Setup

I got this sheet of palette paper. Earth green, raw umber, vanilla yellow, flesh tone. Got a little bit of each color on here, and then I'm going to work it through the bristles together on another sheet of paper.

Let's see what it looks like. Perfect. Remember, we want this to be brighter than our final result because we're going to hit this with a dark wash. Of course, we got to make sure we get those hairs in because the thing will fall apart on us.

## Switching Paints

I'm done with the Scale Color stuff. You can see I added a little bit of water to do some wet blending because it looks more like stone right there. I just worked that around the board.

But now it's getting kind of expensive using those heavy body acrylics. So I'm switching over to Flesh Bronze Tone and Snakebite Leather. I'm going to hit this hard.

## The Mars Effect

It's probably going to look bad, but I'm going to tone it all back down with a wash. I really want to make this pop, but I don't want to be here all day.

It looks pretty crazy right now—almost looks like Mars really. If I didn't want to go back to the oil wash, this would probably be a good Mars board. But that oil wash is going to bring it back down to brown.

That's why everything is kind of a step higher—reds, oranges, greens. There's no actual grays. This gray over here for the rock? That was made from the green and the red.

## Christmas Eve Multitasking

Going to let this dry. I got to finish wrapping the very last bit of Christmas presents—luckily we're almost all done with all that.

Then finally, oil wash time. I'll let the oil wash do its thing. Then we got to do the rim—probably do the rim later because I don't know what color I want yet.

But I think we're there!

## End of Day

Now we're fully dry from this morning. I haven't oil washed it yet—I'm not going to because I got to finish up Christmas Eve shenanigans. But this is where we're looking.
