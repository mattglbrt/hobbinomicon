## Transcript

Do you guys ever find yourself in the middle of a hobby project, a miniature painting project specifically, and then suddenly realize that you've totally forgotten how to paint a miniature? Because that's where I'm at right now.

Today is client office day, so I'm not going to be able to paint that much. And I think it's good that I'm going to be able to step away from it.

Yesterday I used the wrong ink. I used Yellow Orange Aizu instead of Tangerine, which they look very similar in the bottle and I think just a lack of sleep. So that's why my paint was reacting weird. I don't even know if I got to that point in the video yesterday because I was just so tired, but none of the paint I was putting on top of that yellow was sticking to it. It was all kind of like pulling up and almost like separating. And you can kind of see like this is not speed paint that's doing that. This is just like normal green paint that I had I think from Vallejo.

But I figured out I got the robes. I'm going to run with this bluish. This is Tyrian Blue. This is a speed paint on the robes. I'm going to do this for the base coat. And you'll see the preshading still comes through where it matters. But I just—I was like, what is going on?

So got some sleep, was finally able to sleep. Going to just spend the day away from it. Just cut all the robes. I'll probably hand brush the rest of it. But I was sitting down looking at today and I'm like, I forgot how to use a paintbrush. So, just going to shake it off. And tonight hopefully just get a couple of robes done. Just kind of feel it. Maybe figure out something for the skin. I was playing around with it a little bit. I think I've got something that's going to work.

But yeah, I don't know. Just—that happens to me frequently while I'll be in the middle of a big project. I'm like I totally forgot how to do this. So that's it for right now. Quick one for the day.

And also I have a question for the 10 people who consistently watch all my videos that I deeply appreciate. Do you guys like this vlog style? Do you like more of like tip style? Like should I—from—I'm still going to hobby every day, but instead of doing like this vlog kind of thing, do you just want to see like here's a tip from what I've done today that I can share with you? Or do you like the vlogging, the silliness?

That's it. Thanks.

Okay, I'm back after a very very long day. I don't want to try to sit down and paint some goblins just because it's so late and they're already gotta recover from a silly mistake again. These goblins are cursed.

So, I'm just going to do a quick simple project to keep the momentum. This guy's been sitting on my desk for literally 6 months to get his little horn fixed. And I'm out of super glue. All right. I actually got a little dollop out of there. Don't think that's the right horn. I got two of these guys that are broken. There we go. That's the right horn.

And hey, cheesy cheesy video. But I'm doing something very small when I felt like giving up that I'm going to be in a better position tomorrow for. And that's a win. And sometimes that's all it takes.

So that's my lesson. Get a small win every day. So thanks. I'll be back tomorrow with like a—a six-hour long painting video. Oh, no, not a six-hour long painting video. I'm going to be back after painting for six hours tomorrow because I can go very hard in the morning and again very hard at the end of the night. So, tomorrow will be a real video.
