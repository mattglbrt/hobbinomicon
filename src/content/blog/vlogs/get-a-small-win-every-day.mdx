## Forgetting How to Paint

Do you guys ever find yourself in the middle of a hobby project and suddenly realize you've totally forgotten how to paint a miniature? Because that's where I'm at right now.

Today is client office day, so I won't be able to paint that much. And I think it's good that I'll be able to step away from it.

## The Yellow Ink Disaster

Yesterday I used the wrong ink—yellow orange Aozu instead of tangerine. They look very similar in the bottle, and with lack of sleep, I grabbed the wrong one. That's why my paint was reacting weird.

None of the paint I was putting on top of that yellow was sticking. It was all pulling up and almost separating. This isn't speed paint doing that—it's normal green paint from Vallejo just not behaving.

## Rolling With It

I figured out the robes. I'm going to run with this bluish Tyrion Blue speed paint as the base coat. The preshading still comes through where it matters.

Got some sleep, going to spend the day away from it, cut all the robes. I'll probably hand brush the rest. But I was sitting down looking at today thinking "I forgot how to use a paintbrush." Just going to shake it off.

## A Question for You

For the 10 people who consistently watch all my videos that I deeply appreciate: do you like this vlog style? Or more of a tip style—like here's a tip from what I've done today that I can share with you? Do you like the vlogging, the silliness?

## The Small Win

I'm back after a very long day. I don't want to try to paint goblins just because it's so late and I've got to recover from a silly mistake again. These goblins are cursed.

So I'm just going to do a quick simple project to keep the momentum. This guy has been sitting on my desk for literally 6 months to get his little horn fixed. And I'm out of super glue.

Actually got a little dollop out of there. Wrong horn—got two of these guys broken. There we go, that's the right horn.

## The Lesson

Cheesy video, but I'm doing something very small when I felt like giving up that's going to put me in a better position tomorrow. And that's a win.

Sometimes that's all it takes. Get a small win every day.

I'll be back tomorrow after painting for six hours because I can go very hard in the morning and again very hard at the end of the night. Tomorrow will be a real video.
