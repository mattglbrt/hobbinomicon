## 90 Days Changed Everything

90 days of daily video uploads. Crazy. Awesome.

This has been transformational in my life. I'm eating better. I'm exercising. I'm spending more time with the kids, doing cooler things, being more present with them, being more present with my wife.

I'm not just daydreaming about being down here in my basement playing with my toys—I'm actually down here playing with them. And that has just made my life so much better. When you're a 35-year-old man playing with little figures a little bit every day, your life just gets better.

## The Website Announcement

I built myself a website: hobbynomicon.com. Right now I just loaded all my videos in with the transcripts. I realized I say "um" and "ah" and apparently "snort" quite a bit. I'm very sorry. I didn't realize just how much I was doing that.

I feel so much more comfortable talking to the camera now. I feel better just being goofy, showing who I actually am and not being so uptight.

## My Career Shift

I built a career in marketing—not BS marketing, but growth hacking, RevOps, getting businesses true leads and making them a ton of money. I rose to the top of that. Hated it.

I spent 20 years building that career, realized about three years ago I didn't want to be in corporate or Silicon Valley anymore, came back to Virginia, started consulting locally. But it just didn't feel right.

I had been planning on 2026 being the year of building that consultancy, but I was dragging my feet on it even though I'm as broke as I've ever been right now.

## The Big Announcement

Going into next year, I'm keeping current clients but giving up trying to find more. Instead, I'm going to build a miniatures company.

I don't know anything about making miniatures. I'm getting pretty good at 3D printing and recasting. But I want to build my own company. I want to work with sculptors, help artists get their stuff out there. I want to use my skill set to help creative people who maybe don't know the business side.

## The Second Channel

I'm starting a second daily upload channel focused on building a business. If you're an artist who wants to start your own business, that's what it'll be about—how to survive as an artist, how to start with no money, no funding. Just me showing up every day.

This will probably be the last time I mention it here. I want to keep this channel fun and focused on the hobby.

## The Next 90 Days

**Dolmenwood Campaign**: One man, one beard, five characters, solo play. First episode drops next week. My goal is Tales of the Manorwood style, though it'll be janky since I've never tried this before.

**Trench Crusade Projects**: Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent, The Great Hunger, Heretics, Iron Sultanate, finishing up Trench Pilgrims, maybe New Antioch.

**Commissions**: I have a 5-10 figure Infinity commission, a full JSA sectoral commission, and a Warmachine Dusk army commission. All starting before the end of the year.

That's the next 90 days: Dolmenwood, Trench Crusade, Infinity, Warmachine, and a whole lot of goofiness.

## Thank You

Thanks for watching. Thanks for your support. Thanks for being here with me. Thanks for helping me figure out the next chapter of my life.

Go check out my Hobby Nomicon website—no ads, just transcripts and all my videos with some Easter eggs I added. I built a pretty crazy search feature.

These 90 days have changed my life. I'm excited for the next 90.
