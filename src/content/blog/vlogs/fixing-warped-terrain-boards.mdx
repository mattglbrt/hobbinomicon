## Despite Our Drill Press Idea

They warped. One didn't, which is interesting. All the others are higher in the corners than the middle. The seams are pretty deep because of it.

The block boards are still insanely wet after 36 hours—just how much glue I put between them. Not going to be ready for paint today.

## The New Plan

**4x4 Layout**: Glue four tiles to MDF, gap fill the seams. Keep the tiled ones separate for modularity.

- 2x2 for Relic Blade or Frostgrave
- 1x1 for crews or whatever
- The unwarped hill tile stays separate so I can move it around

## Transition Tiles

Making two more tiles that are "crumbling in"—transitioning from perfect squares to earth. Won't be an abrupt change. Using off-cuts as crumbling squares around the edges, like there were tiles here once but not anymore.

## The Fix

Using Eco Weld (resin glue from leather working) on the porous side of MDF. Glued everything down, put a bunch of books on top.

12 hours later: finally dry! Still a little wiggle but these boys are solid. Fixed the warping problem.

## The Project Backlog

I went from no hobby projects to being in a pickle:
- This board project
- Commission work (Infinity figures)
- Army for Call to Arms
- Whole table's worth of terrain
- All the Trench Crusade stuff
- Rest of the Molly Crew dudes

Got to get to painting like crazy!
