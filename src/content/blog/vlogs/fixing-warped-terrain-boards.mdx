## Transcript

Despite our drill press idea, they warped. This one didn't warp, which is interesting. But all of the other ones are higher in the corners than they are in the middle. And I knew there was going to be seams, but because of the warping, like the seams are pretty deep. And up against the blocks, like the seams won't be that noticeable, I'm hoping. And speaking of the blocks, all of the block boards are still like insanely wet. I guess that's just because of how much glue I put in between them. They've been sitting for 36 hours. So, today is not going to be as exciting when it comes to those as I thought it would be because I don't think they'll be ready for paint today. But, I'm going to try to fix these. And this will be 3x3, which is pretty cool. So just what I'm thinking. Actually, what I'm going to do is put the phone down and think for a second, and then I'll be right back.

But this is going to be the layout for 4x4. And I'm going to glue like all these four. I'm going to mount like an MDF I have sitting over there. And then I'll gap fill the seams. And then all of these like tiled ones I'll keep separate so I can move them around and that way I'll have like a 2x2 for like Blades of Khorne or Frostgrave. I'll still have the 1x1 for my like crews or whatever I want to use them for and I'll be able to like still keep those extremely modular. I keep this one separate and then these four I'll glue down.

Maybe actually I probably won't glue this one down just because like of the hill and keep it so I can like pop—like if I want to pop it here or something like that. And also it's not warped, right? That one's good. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to make with my remaining squares—I'm going to make two more that are like this that are like crumbling in and make a transition to like this kind of earth. So that way it won't go from like fully perfect squares and just abruptly change. It'll be something like this to where like this kind of makes sense like we're leading into that. Again, it's going to take some love to get it there. But I'll make transitionary tiles from tiles to earth. And that's what I'll use for the three gaps that are missing here and glue all these together. Glue these down.

And also like I'm going to take these off cuts I had and like cut them into squares and I'll put these like crumbling on the tile. So these will serve like around the edges and things and it'll be like maybe there were tiles here or at one point in time this was tile too but it's not anymore. And then I think we'll have a pretty cool board.

All right, we're just going for it. I'm using the porous side of the MDF which is also probably going to make it warp. But I think it's going to—I will work. I'm using Eco Weld, which has resin and I use it with leather working, but you can also use it with wood and I'm hoping that this foam and MDF will suck it up.

Okay, so this is all glued down and I'm about to put a bunch of books on top of it again. But I just wanted to make sure everything was as even as I could get it. It's been 12 hours since I recorded this morning and these are finally dry. These guys are all dry. Dry. There's still a little bit of wiggle, but other than that like these boys are—they're solid. I was happy with that.

I pulled a corner up here of books just to take a look at how we're going. It's still not totally dry, but we are definitely like fix the warping part—or problem. I need to go back in and like trim up a little bit of overhang, but I am pretty happy. I'm going to put the books back on just because I'm going to let it sit overnight just to be sure because I'm sick of playing games with these boards.

I want to get this whole project done so I can move on to some other projects. I have this commission I still need to finish. I have this commission I need to finish—these guys. So, I'm going to have to either finish that board project like tomorrow or at least get really close and done with it tomorrow or come back to it because I have to finish my actual army for Call to Arms and I'm going to do a whole table's worth of terrain for that event. I'm going to use like the mat that I had that's underneath the boards, not actual boards, but I got to paint all the terrain on top of it.

And then also I still have all the Trench Crusade stuff and I still have the rest of the actual dudes to play Motley Crews. So, I went from not having any hobby projects going on to being in a pickle. So, I got to get to painting like crazy. So, last couple days have been a little boring on the vlog and that's why they've been so short. But, next week, I'm going to be doing a lot of really cool stuff. And I've also started cleaning up the workshop to make it more actually usable and so I can like go around and give you guys tours and stuff. Because there's a lot of cool stuff in here, but it's just all taken apart right now. I'll see you guys tomorrow. I appreciate you.

Oh, if you're still here—if you know, you know. I finally ordered the stuff I needed to get started with this project. So that'll be coming soon.
