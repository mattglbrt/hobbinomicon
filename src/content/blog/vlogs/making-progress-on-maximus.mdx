## A Reality Check from Daily Vlogging

What's up? I don't even know what day this is in the hobby streak anymore—I've got to check my records. Welcome to the Hobby Nomicon.

I don't know exactly what I'm doing today, but I know I've got to finally get this room organized. I cleaned it, then junked it up again because I didn't organize it properly. Now I'm right back to where I started 100 days ago. The craziest thing about recording yourself every day is realizing just how much of a lazy person you are. So I've got to fix it—I can't keep living like this.

That's why we're doing it today. We're getting our act together because there's this bookshelf and I'm not even shelving with it, I'm stacking with it. All of my shelves are like that.



So my wife's using the Alexa to contact me because I was ignoring a text message.

Check out this thick poster they gave me yesterday—it's the same on the front and back, and it's really thick too.

## Life Happens

About 10 minutes after I started that other video, I found out I had to take my son back to CHKD. We're good now though—just another false alarm from his pediatrician on a follow-up appointment. Everything's good. He's recovering from being sick as expected, but some things freaked the pediatrician out. We're all good now.

This video isn't going to be great—I'm just kind of limping through the day. About to get a little bit of painting done before I crash. It ended up being all good, but it's very taxing when you don't know that's going to be the case.

## New Miniatures on the Horizon

Have you ever seen a miniature and just instantly fallen in love? This is one of the ogres from Knucklebone Miniatures—I think it's relatively new. Had to get this printed off.

I finished up the last 120mm for Crucible Guard and just threw this guy on the plate. He's going to be one of our two Dolmenwood miniatures for this week. I finally got him primed—I'm just going to brush prime this other guy. I need to get a base for him.

## Working Through Maximus

I've been working through Maximus. I realized the shield is still in early stages, just kind of base coated really, but you can see I put a lot of work into this white and purple armor. I'm pretty happy with it.

The white is done. I've got to do the shoulder pads—these are going to be a different color. But the rest of it, the legs, and the custom base are all done. So that's the hobby I got done today.

## Wrapping Up

It's been a very rough couple of days, but I think we're finally good. Just wanted to explain why these last couple of videos have been kind of rough. But I'm really looking forward to painting these new models. After today, hopefully we'll have a return to normal—I won't be spending 90% of my day panicking.

While I was editing, I realized I'm losing my voice again. I dry brushed this dude and then went back in and sketched in some highlights with a brush. Now he'll be fully dry and primed.

Thanks for watching. Thanks for being here. Your support has actually been pretty cool to see—this amount of people watching and commenting. I really appreciate you guys. It means a lot. See you tomorrow.
