## Transcript

Got my coffee and now we're going to do the first pass of preshading. We're going to hit everything up with that Hexed Lichen that's over my shoulder. Just like we did the squigs, we're going to spend a little bit more time preshading these.

One thing that's important is I got everybody out of the danger zone and I have a shelf under this table too that I've got stuff stacked in. I don't want any overspray to happen. So we're going to keep our actual workspace clear.

And as I'm airbrushing them, if I come in across somebody like this who has a robe on, he's going to go in one area and then somebody like this who isn't robed and is like normal skin, he's going to go in another area because we'll be able to do a lot of airbrush work on the robes still. But not this obviously. So we want to start kind of getting a lot more organized than how we are now. So I'm going to slot you in and I'm going to get to work.

So, we're going to come up from the bottom with Hexed Lichen. We're going to come down from the top with our—or actually we'll do a zenithal. We'll do purple up and then white down.

I got a lot of fans going. But this is where we're at. So, you can see like all from the bottom up, but if you look at the tops, there's still very much black on the top for now. Most of them, some of them I got a little greasy with, but that's okay. We'll be able to fix it. I did all the goblins.

And then we'll hit it from the top down with this ink. And then we will mix a little bit of white in with this ink. Hit it from the top again. And that way that's going to have like that Ninjon style preshading where everything is kind of unified together just like our squigs are. And that will keep them all looking kind of like they're in the same place because there's going to be a lot of different colors in the actual army itself.

I've been trying to think through how I'm going to do it actual paint wise. I'm not 100% sure yet. So, I think we're just going to kind of vibe it out and see how it goes. But, I'm about to dig in and we'll be back.

Okay, so the squigs already look pretty great if you wanted yellow squigs. But this is just our preshade layer. So, I'm going to come in with the magenta that we use on our big squigs and just kind of show you how this preshading works because now I can just come in and blast this magenta and we get all the volumes and the shading of the squig.

So, we're not done with the squig skin. We'll still come back in with a brush and do a little bit of like final highlights, but all the volumes in the squig are done from this priming. And the goblins are going to be the same way.

So, even though the goblins will be a different color and we're going to cover the last four hours of airbrush work that we did, it's going to have this huge effect that really adds all the volume to the paint job.

Here is all of the squigs done. The lighting does not do it justice. Should have got a better photo.

I've started trying to work on the goblins and at this point I only got four hours of sleep just because the babies did not have a good night last night. So, I didn't wait long enough for the last coat of that ink to dry, and it's causing the green to have this like mottled effect, which is terrible.

So, I'm going to go ahead and call it for today, and we'll pick back up tomorrow.
