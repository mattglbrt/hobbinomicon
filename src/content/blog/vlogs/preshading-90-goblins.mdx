## Coffee and Preshading

Got my coffee, now we're doing the first pass of preshading. Hitting everything with hex-lichen just like we did the squigs, but spending a bit more time.

## Workspace Organization

Got everybody out of the danger zone—don't want any overspray. As I airbrush, I'm sorting: robed goblins go in one area (more airbrush work), non-robed ones go in another.

## The Preshade Method

1. **Hex-lichen from below** - Coming up from the bottom
2. **Purple ink from above** - Standard zenithal approach
3. **White mixed with ink** - Final hit from the top

This gives that Ninja-style preshading where everything is unified together, just like our squigs. When there's lots of different colors in the actual army, this keeps them looking like they're in the same place.

## The Squigs Already Look Great

The squigs already look amazing—like if you wanted yellow squigs, you could almost stop here! But this is just the preshade layer.

Coming in with magenta and blasting it on—all the volumes and shading are done from our priming. We'll still come back with brushwork for final highlights, but the heavy lifting is done.

## The Sleep-Deprived Mistake

Only got 4 hours of sleep—babies did not have a good night. Didn't wait long enough for the last coat of ink to dry, and it's causing the green to have this mottled effect, which is terrible.

Going to call it for today and pick back up tomorrow.
