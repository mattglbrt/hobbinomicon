## Day One of Taking Painting Seriously

This is day one of trying to get good and taking painting seriously. I'm starting with Richard Gray's guide on how to paint a leather belt.

## The Color Lineup

I'm using Mourning Brown as my base, Bugman's Glow for the pink highlights, Yellow Ochre (closest I have to Cadian Flesh Tone), and Buff (instead of Moras Bone). I'm going by what my computer screen shows.

And I finally broke out my fresh-out-of-the-package Windsor Newton Series 7. I told myself I was saving it, and I've had it for a couple years now.

## The Importance of Drying

Just finished base coating. You can see it's still a little wet. If I don't let this layer dry and start trying to highlight it, I'm going to tear this layer. That's the secret to getting smooth finishes—you have to let layers dry.

I could hit it with a heat gun, but instead I'll paint another section while this dries.

## Building Texture with Brush Strokes

It's not really stippling. I'm using brush strokes to build texture carefully. And I need to put in some strokes and then move on—I don't want to overwork an area.

It really does feel like sketching. You're creating this texture. And again, I'm not actually a professional yet—just a guy trying to figure it out.

## The Bugman's Glow Step

This Bugman's Glow is just on the very tip of the brush—barely any on there. I don't want it to turn pink, but I do want to paint the highlights with it.

I'm putting it right where the leather is bending, where the pull-up is occurring, where it would be worn and tattered. It's almost like a cracked leather effect because these are the Last Hunt and the last of the Nysss—I'm imagining all their stuff is super old, well-maintained but well-worn.

## The Realization

Even a year ago, I would have said no way to this kind of painting. And I'm just sitting here doing it really just because I decided I wanted to.

When you look at results that someone like Richard gets as a whole—looking at the whole miniature—it's very daunting and intimidating. But when you get up close, it's really...

I'm a normal dude. I'm not a professional painter. I don't have a classical paint background. I've been painting miniatures for a very long time. But my point is: if you paint enough miniatures, you get the brush control. If you understand your paints, it's not that it's easy, but I wouldn't call it hard.

## An Hour and a Half Later

After about an hour and a half of real time painting, I'm going to call the belts themselves done. Still got to do the buckles.

It doesn't look as bright in person. You can see as I turn it how it's actually dark and does look leatherish. I'm excited—it looks great!
