## New Camera Setup

New camera angle - hopefully you can see better now. Same terrain setup: big face card, bugs, grass. The face lets us climb on top for more range and accuracy.

## The Strategy

Ground fighting again like last time. Feeling more prepared - strategies forming in my head.

**The plan:**
1. Use Cat Eye Circlet to see top 3 hit locations
2. Stack the deck to avoid traps
3. Knock the lion down with crits
4. Pile on wounds while it's vulnerable

## The Fight Goes South

Started strong - archer crits with the catgut bow, knocking the lion down. But then Sophia can't hit anything. She's "Sophia the Inaccurate" today.

**Disaster strikes:**
- Sophia fails a fist and tooth attack
- Lion gets a reaction - basic action with +2 damage
- Both hits land on head and waist
- Heavy wound to head, knocked down
- She gets 4 bleeding tokens

She's one more bleed from death and already knocked down. Can only take one more wound.

## Learning the Hard Way

I've been forgetting several things:
- Evasion - need to look up what it actually does
- Dodging with survival - could have avoided that head hit
- Surge - apparently I can't do it now due to an injury (didn't even know what it was)
- **Everyone has -1 speed** from an earlier event - would have been huge

## The Lick Wounds Problem

Drew Lick Wounds - if the monster has no wounds in its AI deck, it heals one and the card goes to the top of the deck. We have to get a wound in to clear it.

The lion keeps healing while we struggle to land hits.

## Pulling It Together

Finally remembered to use survival abilities. Dodged a head hit that would have killed our archer. Started using the Cat Eye Circlet to stack the hit location deck properly.

**Key crits:**
- Archer lands fractured shoulder (-1 movement token)
- Clinestra keeps rolling natural crits
- Sophia finally wounds with the bone club - fleshy gut crit gives +3 insanity and a free resource

## The Kill

Clinestra finishes it by critting the beast tail - we get the lion tail resource AND it's the killing wound.

**Loot:** Perfect hide, three monster hides, golden whiskers, shimmering mane, gray cat bones, sinew, and the tail.

## Settlement Event: Nickname

Everyone rolls on the nickname tables. We're all Dingles apparently:
- Sophia: Dingle Hero of the Antelope (+1 strength!)
- Others: Various Dingle titles

## The Confession

I've been cheating. I don't have the Encourage survival skill unlocked - you need it from innovations. Also forgot Kip can only move 4 spaces.

Fixing it going forward. The game is hard enough without my mistakes working in my favor.

## Next Steps

- Settlement at 7 population (used intimacy with Clinestra's Matchmaker ability)
- Unlocked Screaming Antelope hunting
- Built ammonia innovation
- Crafting whisker harp, lion headdress, bandages, and last rawhide armor set

Decision time: fight the lion again to get more claws and fur for cat armor, or jump into the Screaming Antelope blind?
