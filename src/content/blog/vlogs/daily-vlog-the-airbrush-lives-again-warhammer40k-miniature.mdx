## Quick Update

Going to do a quick one tonight. I got the goblins all prepped and they're ready to be assembled. I'll be able to get them built and primed tomorrow.

## The Game-Changer I Never Knew Existed

Right now I want to talk to you about this little guy. Got it off Amazon for $17. It screws onto your airbrush hose and it's a moisture trap.

Even though I have windows down here, I am in the basement (which is why I call it the dungeon). This screws into your airbrush hose, and it comes with a little baggie of adapters that screw into multiple kinds of airbrushes.

This is my old and now retired Iwata. The adapter screws on and now it's a quick release that you just pop in. Whoa—apparently it's got some spring action to it.

## Ten Years and I Had No Idea

I didn't know this existed. I've been airbrushing for over 10 years, which is crazy because in my head I just started airbrushing. I found out about this from the Ice King who's letting me borrow his airbrush. Of course he had one on here and I just had no idea.

## Testing It Out

I got the compressor hooked up to a remote. No leakage, PSI is holding strong. This thing is awesome. It's going to make cleaning so much easier. And if you have multiple airbrushes, it'd be way easier to switch between them.

### Bonus Feature

What's cool is the compressor is on and this is still holding the pressure in. I can now take the airbrush off, go swap colors out, and not have to worry about turning my compressor on and off.

Sounds very first world problem, but if you're doing a big project or there's a lot of cleaning out the pot—and I have to walk pretty far to get to the slop sink down here—that's going to actually be pretty cool.

## That's It

Quick one tonight. Extremely tired. Finally got the airbrush working but it's too late to start actually priming. Just wanted to show you this really cool quick-release thing. Pop. Thanks for watching.
