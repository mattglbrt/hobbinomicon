## Day 60 of Daily Vlogs

We're revisiting the Molly Crew board because I never really finished up the edges. Painting it black made it look finished, and I left a little Easter egg where the mold comes over the side.

I watched the original Nummark video again and he had two little stone mountain things, some trees, and a little Koi guy. So for our 60th daily vlog, we're going to finish the board so I can finally play.

## Reference from Turkish Quarries

For inspiration, I'm using photos from Göreme in Turkey—those big quarries where the stones are still partially embedded. These are the shapes we're using for reference on how weathered stone blocks would look.

## Building the Stone Blocks

Using leftover cubes and an X-acto knife, I plucked some pieces out and smoothed down hard edges. On one piece, I hit it with a heat gun for that melty effect. I'm going to use resin to put water pooling in the holes on top.

For the texture effects, I used a lighter—probably not the safest method, but it worked. Then covered everything in basing material, which was kind of a mistake because of dry time.

## The Demon Prints Head

Digging through the bits box, I found a Demon Prints head from Miscast. He sent me a few of these because of air bubbles in the nose. The normal one is for casting the actual Demon Prints, but this one is perfect to stick on the side of a block—the broken nose actually works for the aesthetic.

I used the rough edge of the geode on green stuff to simulate that broken-off nose effect, tweaking with an X-acto knife until it looked right.

## Lesson Learned

I didn't think this through—it's going to take forever to dry, and then I still have to prime it. A one-day project that takes several hours to dry is not very smart. Six hours later and they're still pretty wet.
