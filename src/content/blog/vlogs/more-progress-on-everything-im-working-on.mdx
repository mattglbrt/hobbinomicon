## Morning Update

9:00 AM with some morning coffee. Finished the top buckle the same way as the bottom one. Didn't want to keep making the same video over again.

## Not Missing a Video

Your boy's not going to miss a video upload. That magnifier messed my forehead up, but it grows crazy on the sides and bottom, just not on top.

## 3D Printing Plans

Today is the second run on the 3D printer. Got a little tiny bit of resin left, seeing if I can print a few more nuns for Trench Pilgrims. That's probably all the resin I have.

After things settle down from the holidays, I'll bulk order resin to save money.

### The Print Queue
- **Trench Pilgrims**: Mostly done, going to finish them
- **Iron Sultanate Heretics**: Going to print these
- **Courts**: Already printed most of them
- **New Antioch**: Don't like a lot of those models—I like the machine armor dudes, so I'll use some in my heretics with a heretic paint job

Mostly interested in actually playing the bad guys. Probably going to pass on New Antioch as an army. I just don't like being the good guys.

## The Belt Revisited

Looking at the belt, I want to establish the shadows more. Happy with the top highlight and the texture. The brush strokes are so fine it's hard to see on camera.

Went back in and added more purple in the shadows. Trying to get the best lighting. I think it looks really good.

## Happy Thanksgiving

If you're in America, happy Thanksgiving! You're probably watching this tomorrow. See you then.
