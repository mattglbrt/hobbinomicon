## Finishing Character Sheets

Hobby vlog day 95. I was finishing up Dolmenwood character sheets and everybody's done except our hunter has an animal companion. I planned on it being a hound, but I didn't realize that Dolmenwood has its own actual hound section—which is pretty awesome!

## The Langston Mastiff

We're going to run with a Langston Mastiff because that's the closest thing to the figure we have 3D printed. So it's awesome. He has his own rules!

We're going to have to drop him down to level one because of the animal companion rules, but I'll probably keep these stats the same. I think it's probably a little bit different than intended for animal companions, but this is just too awesome not to do.

If a Langston fails a morale check, there's a two in six chance it'll go wild, attacking anyone who comes near to it—and that state is permanent if that happens. Pretty cool!

## Correction from Character Creation

Also, if you watched the character creation video, one thing I missed—I wasn't really paying attention and totally forgot how making a character works. I wrote the weapon damage in their attack field for some reason, but the attacks are actually specified per class in the class tables right next to the hit points and save targets. That was a little bit silly.

## Magic Resistance Note

There is magic resistance in Dolmenwood, but so far the only thing I came across that had it was the elf—it just explicitly says the elf has magic resistance. I think the magical kindreds have magic resistance, but none of the other classes or races we're playing have it.

## Ready to Play

So we are ready to begin! The very next Dolmenwood video you see from me will probably be a live play. I got to think through how I'm going to do it. It'll probably be a mix of on the tabletop with real models and theater of mind until I get more stuff built and painted.

This one's going to be a really big source of inspiration for me that I'm very excited about.

## Other Projects

I've got some Ultimate Dungeon Terrain that I started at the very beginning of the channel. I need to make the other half of my board—the grass and field part. So I'll probably finish that up and make a video out of that. I want to wrap up all these random projects before the end of the year.

This is going to be a quick one. Just all the Dolmenwood characters are made, all the sheets are made, all the figures are printed. Time to get back into hobbying and painting and making stuff. My paperwork is complete!

See you tomorrow for day 96.
