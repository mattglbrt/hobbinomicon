## Day 98: Not Stopping

Pretty sick. But it's day 98 and we're not going to stop. We're going to keep trucking with a quick one.

## The Sealing Recipe

Mod Podge. A little bit of black or gray primer mixed in. I'm actually going to brush it on because there are some open pink foam spots. I don't want the spray to melt them.

Two quick things: I mixed in some water to make it a little bit thinner because Mod Podge can actually cover up some of your detail if you're not careful. And I'm making sure I cover up this pink edge so I can hit this with spray primer later to get the color I want.

## Going Too Thick

I realized in some of these parts I went on too thick. So I'm using a paper towel and just dabbing it to get up the extra. Then I'll spread it out a little bit better.

The Mod Podge got a little thick so I hit it with Elmer's glue and isopropyl alcohol to thin it out. Now we're painted and that Mod Podge didn't take away any of our detail—which if you're not careful it definitely will do.

## The Layering Process

At this point, this has now been hit with:
1. The initial straight Elmer's glue layer that everything stuck to
2. Then water—50% water, 50% glue—and a little bit of isopropyl alcohol
3. This has now gone through four layers of that
4. This final layer is just Mod Podge matte mixed with my gray primer

## Why It Works

This is now going to be indestructible. This is how I used to do all my gaming tables back in the Warhammer Fantasy days. It's how we did all the hills. This is going to be able to take a beating.

Tomorrow I'll be able to hit it with rattle cans, then come in with the airbrush with some different browns, lock that in, and then it's time for flock. We're in the final stretch of this thing.

## Almost to 100

We're closing in on 100 days straight of hobbying and we're almost at 100 subscribers—which is also pretty cool. Never in my life would have expected that. Thanks again, see you tomorrow for day 99!
