## Mail Call Day

The boxes are pretty beat up. I'm a little worried about the condition of what's inside.

## The First Box

Got this secondhand—old enough that it came with a magnet pack! Pretty sick. Hopefully we caught this at the time where we got the good new resin but still got magnets.

Looks like we're good. Great quality. I paid probably what the magnets alone would have cost. Huge win. Shout out to eBay.

## The Fantasm Unbox

This is what I'm really excited about. The box the post office jacked up though, so we'll see.

These are substantial pieces. At least one's already broken. It feels bad when you know it's going to be broken and it just becomes a matter of how badly. But compared to my Mercs Crixus, we're off to a much better start.

## Damage Report

Only one thing broken—clean snaps that I can figure out where they go. This base is cool and hefty—printed solid.

## Supporting Early Adopters

You have to be an early adopter to support the company like this. I believe in what SFG is doing and they're really doing some things great. But for someone new to the hobby, the breakage might be off-putting.

In the scale of things, this is not a huge problem. Still easier to clean up than a Forge World model. I could probably hit up SFG and get a replacement since their customer support is that good, but I'm not going to because that's not cool.

## The Decision

If you're watching this, I decided that I'm going full-time into Dusk, baby.
