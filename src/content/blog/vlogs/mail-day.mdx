## Transcript

Oh, it's mail call day. I don't know when I'm actually going to be posting this, but the boxes are pretty beat up. I'm a little bit worried about the condition of what's going to be in here.

Oh, wow. This is—so, this is old enough that I've got a magnet pack. I got this secondhand. Got a pretty good deal on it. Pretty sick that it's old enough. Or actually, I don't know. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Because it's old burly resin. Hopefully, we caught this at the time where we got the good new resin, but we still got magnets. And it looks like we're good. So great, great quality. I don't want to take everything out. Look at this. Oh, wow. Look at that. It's still together in one piece. This is a huge win. I was not—I paid a very like negligible amount for this and like I paid probably more than what the—I probably paid what the magnets would have cost me to go buy. That's crazy. Big win. Shout out to eBay.

All right. Now, this one, this is what I'm really excited about. But also the box that it came in. Like I think like the post office jacked this up. So we'll see.

Oh, these are substantial.

Ah, at least one's already broken.

I mean, it's like it does feel bad that you know it's going to be broken and it just becomes a matter of how badly it's going to be broken. A little bit of supports we have to remove.

Heat that back up. That won't be too big of a deal.

Overall, I mean, compared to my Cricks—the Merk Cricks I got, this is—we're off to a much better start for sure.

Maybe nothing is broken. Maybe.

Oh, no. Well, so far only one thing broken, but that's not—jeez. Okay, so we got this.

These are our parts.

Clean snaps. If I can figure out where they go. I have a feeling it's maybe—it's off of this. I don't know. I'll look at that off camera so I don't waste any more of your guys' time.

I'm just kind of glad I was able to find these. These are heads. It looks like small parts. Nothing seems broken here. I don't know if you can tell. I don't want to lose parts right now.

You know, I want to—I want to be a fan and I want to support SFG and I think what they're doing is great. This base is cool. This is a hefty—this is printed solid. This is a hefty boy.

Very cool.

I think it's—you got to like this. You have to be an early adopter to support the company like this just because I do believe in what they're doing and I think they're really doing some things great. But it just doesn't—like if you were new to the hobby and maybe they just know that most of their customers are not new to the hobby.

So they're going to know how to deal with this because like in the scale of things this is not a huge problem. I just got to figure out where this thing is supposed to go. But like this is no big deal. Like none of this stuff is a problem. It's still—I was just kind of talking trash on it. This is still easier to clean up than a Forge World model. Like this is still way less work than a Forge World model would be.

All right, there we go. That's where it goes. It broke.

Okay, so yeah, in the scale of things, I'm happy. Like it's not—not anything major. Like a couple of minor breaks. Nothing that I'm going to like complain about. I think if I was a shyer person, I could hit up SFG and say, "Oh, this is broken and get a second one." Because I think their customer support is that good. I'm not going to just because that's not cool.

But, it's time to get it built. And I don't know when I'm going to post this, but if you're watching this, I decided that I'm going full-time into Dusk, baby.
