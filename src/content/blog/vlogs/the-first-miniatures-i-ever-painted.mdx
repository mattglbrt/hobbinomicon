## Transcript

Okay, so last night I started cleaning out that closet behind me. And look what I found. The very first miniature I ever painted. So, let's zoom in on it. Look at him in all his glory.

I remember thinking that this was the very first unique I ever pulled and it's the only unique I had for a very long time actually when I was playing Mage Knight. So, I slammed him in every army. You can see I have him. I have his buddy that I also repainted. Look at that face. Look at that beautiful face. I have him. I have his buddy. And I honestly don't know what I was thinking here. Polka-dotted. I don't know. I have no idea. But these are the first three miniatures that I ever painted.

Pretty cool. I did not think I still had these. I thought they were lost to time. It's pretty awesome and I'm just going down memory lane and looking over all this stuff, but we're just going to go down memory lane with this one.

So, this was the very first unique I ever pulled, right? And then these guys were in my starter set and I thought to myself like if I had the strongest healer that I had, it would be so good. But this figure actually kind of sucks. But she had an ability that shared her defense value with these two guys. So I ended up—I just like the trolls. So I had like a ranged fire base. Then this guy actually moved eight. These trolls were slow but they had 12 in range. But this guy was pretty fast and he could hit hard in melee, right? So obviously had to paint those. And I don't—this was not my original Mending Priestess, but it's the one I have now. So she was lost, but she was also painted terribly.

But now you'll see the Wraith was my second unique that I pulled from a booster box and she is—she's dry brushed white. Love this. Literally even after I stopped playing these guys, I had her in everything. And it just turned out that she was like the best model. So I kind of stumbled into a meta list. Like especially back in Rebellion, there was a couple of other—and the way this game was is there was very much always a meta because a lot of the figures just sucked even from the beginning and even though this is like before the internet existed, but my area was pretty competitive. So the meta just naturally emerged.

Anyway, so this is what I played for a very long time. And my imp was painted. I don't have—I don't think I have—oh, wait. Do I? No, I don't. My imp was painted terribly too, but I don't have the one that I painted. So, this was my very first army that I took in all the tournaments and all the events.

Okay. So, after that, it was ranged Death Stars and I started as I started playing and getting more and trading and I think also just people taking pity on me because I was having terrible luck getting things then all of my allowances and all of my birthdays. Like this. My mom wrote this, but and I think this was—this was a gift that I will always cherish. But like it was range Death Star. So Stormbound with magic enhancement. You could swap mages in for magic enhancement and with the mages. You'd actually put him in the back because he could shoot through his people and couldn't be shot or magic enhanced flame lightning Death Star kind of things.

Or I actually—I like the orcs. So and I love like these two are my two favorite figures. So, I play the mages a lot. I played the orcs a lot. And actually, a lot of times what I ended up doing was I would have this group right here. And I would play—I would play something like this line. You can see this. I painted this guy. I'm getting a little bit better, right? A little better color choices there. And I would play like two different—let me make sure. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. So, this is this was like 90ish points. And then over here is like another a little bit over 100. So, I would—this would just be my list would be this two mage blasters, the magically enhanced mage blasters.

And I learned very quickly I had to put this guy in the front because he'd lose Mage Blast and then I'd screw myself. So then I played this for a while and then at this point more sets were coming out. So like lancers and whirlwind. And at that point, I moved around armies so much. I mean, I always went back to the mages a lot and I played so much like I was playing in tournaments almost every day of the week. But I pretty much whenever after I got the Chaos Mage, I was always playing Chaos Mage like period.

But then like I started adding in like this guy, he's 120 points and then my—and armies were 200 points, right? So, this I play this a whole lot and I would—same kind of thing like you have your range base, this guy gets up and this guy was super slow. He'd always get shot off the board or worse. At this point like stuff like this would come in and they'd come in base like this roll for breakaway because they had flight they needed anything but a one and they would do one damage a shake-off and just like—like this guy would be over here and actually he would come in like this and then he's in my—these two be in my rear arc. He'd roll for breakaway shake off damage. I was just terrible and I would just keep getting wrecked by those. But this game is just so fun and I'm having such a happy time reminiscing and thinking about it.

And then I think it was right around when Sinister—I started to get really good when Sinister came out and that's like this isn't—I significantly paired down my collection, but most of this is all just the good figures. Like I kept all the stuff that was worth playing for the most part. And at this point like I was winning events. So like I had Paired Cairo who was like a bounding shooter which was crazy at the time. I had all the Solomon all the Jacronum. And at that point I was just full on in the meta playing the toughest toughest things. I had Wandering Butcher—very rare very cool figure. I had—I lost him in the sword trip, but I had to buy him back because I couldn't not have him. Very cool stuff.

And then at this point, armies would be like four or five figures that were just really good and could take on all comers. So like a lot of this like Weaver was good because it had venom. It was all about like auto damage. So like Ram, Duo Click, Venom. What else would we have?

And I know I did a lot when I wasn't when I was like playing not take it too seriously. I added in the Orc Slaver here. So I would move them I keep them like this at this point because I knew how to protect my shaman a little bit more or my Chaos Mage I mean. And then I added in—I know it's got to be here. Yep. There he is. The Unlimited version.

So when I was playing for fun and the Summoner came out, I played a lot of him and I would do something like this where I was all in one movement formation and then I would—because he has Force March. So the first turn I would just literally run the whole group up and then pass my second turn and then usually like—I like bypassing my whole second turn because I didn't want to push. It was kind of cheesy, but I'd get so much more information because the other people would kind of all move into position. So, I could shoot this guy could like run out and ram somebody and sweep them and then I could like—I would usually move—or actually let me not—I would have this guy right. I'd have these guys facing out because I heal and this guy also heals and I'd have this guy facing in. And I'd have usually I'd move them like this.

The volunteer poor little volunteer guy would be in front. So, usually I would move him around like this and then I'd send this guy out at whatever needed to be killed because he had Ram and Sweep and Command and they're both rolling for Command. So, sometimes I might even get like two or three or an extra action a turn pretty regularly. But this guy could bust off and now this guy has this wall that he can shoot through with plus two. He's gonna—I'm talking just this like you guys know how to play this game, but he when he shoots he could ignore line of sight and he would roll a d6 for damage, but he would get no matter what he'd get plus two. So it'd be the lowest he could possibly do is three and the highest he could do is eight obviously. Or if these guys died, he's just shooting for six every time, which is crazy. And with three healers that like he was never going to die.

So this was my fun army and it was still like pretty cutthroat. But also, it's just such a fun game and I'm just reminiscing so much about how much I love this, how much I still do love it, you know, and really I'm just loving looking at all this stuff and I think it's cool. It also helps you don't have to paint it, so I can just look at it.

I need to get this out and on a shelf somewhere so I can look at it and be happy about it because it's so cool. But I'm looking over here and like at one point I won this guy and then I tried to make these guys work. Like these guys these are super cheap point-wise. It was a point-based army system, but their damage—they had a 10 attack and three damage which at the time or I mean not at the time but like even towards the end of the game that was really good for the points cost but I just kept getting like shot off the board and shredded especially with bound and everything came out.

And then towards the end they dropped all these dual faction models and this guy came out and he had an ability where he could share his 19 defense which in this game was pretty crazy. So I would slot him in. I'd have this guy—this guy makes everybody in the movement formation move 12 in which in this game is crazy. The standard was eight. A lot of people had six. So these guys and—I didn't use red ones. I used the cheaper ones but they would be surrounded in like a little death ball. This was a hero healer if I did get shot and I would just march these guys right up the gut and they're swinging in. They're going to kill whatever they get in contact with. This was a lot of fun, but for the most part, I was playing the meta armies.

And I started—obviously I'm going to have to go and see what else exists online still, but I know towards the end it was all about magic, levitation, and Ram and stuff. Then they FAQed that and they changed it and I played a ton. I'm trying to remember. I think I played like the Wraith. I know this guy—I can't remember why this guy was so good. I think because he had flying and I know he has venom, but I know I played a lot of this guy just because it was a dragon. But he was also very good.

I played a lot—I played a lot of just the mages like by himself just because he had a lot of utility even when you took him out of the Death Star. A lot of like Cavaliers. I never—I had one of these and I could never pull them. But these guys were also very very good. The Wraith always stayed good. Like I literally pretty much played the Wraith in everything I played. Amazon Draconum when she came out. I played a ton of her. She was like, she was pretty busted until people figured out that you had to ram her and that's what made the Ram stuff so good.

But man, oh, I played a lot of Zombie Baron. That guy was really good. I did a lot of stuff with skeletons. So you could—there's necromancy and you could bring back a new figure and they'd be hurt or you could bring back skeletons and skeletons are only 10 points. So you could have a ton of skeletons and just bringing them back and just keep flinging them at people which is really cool. Oh man.
