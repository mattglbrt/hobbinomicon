## The Realization

Thinking I had to have everything painted in order to actually play a game is really holding me back.

## Infinity Is Cursed

I've played a couple of games of Infinity, really love it—probably the most fun I've had in a very long time. Amazing models, some painted, some from trades I didn't finish.

I joke that Infinity is cursed because every time I try to play it, my life falls apart. So I'm afraid to start playing again. I'm getting that itch, but I'm afraid something terrible will happen.

When I started pulling this out, I realized: I don't want to paint this. I want to play it. These are game pieces—I can still play them. Why am I holding myself to this arbitrary rule?

## The Dusk Dilemma

My Dusk cast is magnetized, my 50-point list is ready until the starter set comes out. But I want to paint these to the best of my ability, which means it won't be painted for another year.

And that's when it hit me.

## The Permission

This arbitrary rule of "I want my things painted" when I'm not playing in tournaments—some games I just want to play once or twice and never touch again. I don't have to have fully painted stuff. I just need to get it built.

I'm trying to balance this in my head: I don't have any intentions on painting this stuff, but I have a lot of intentions on playing the game. Maybe after I play it, I'll want to paint it.

## What This Means

- Infinity is ready to play
- I'm going to play Necromunda next month
- I want to paint up Mordheim warbands
- I can play Mollog's Crew without painting them—they don't have to be painted

## The Purge Helped

I've gotten rid of a lot of stuff. Some of the stuff I'm keeping, I'm not going to paint. That's really freeing.

I'm not going to buy any more models until what I have is painted, but I don't have to wait to play with what I'm keeping.

## Finding the Joy

Maybe I spend the rest of the year just building stuff. Getting everything built that I want to play, then worry about painting next year.

I'm giving myself permission to have fun with my toys. It doesn't have to be so crazy. I need to find the joy in it.

So much of it felt like work. I really like building. Maybe I'll put some model kits together and never even paint them. I really like playing—I want to roll dice.

I'm trying to get over this idea that I have to have things painted in order to play. That's the thought of the day.
