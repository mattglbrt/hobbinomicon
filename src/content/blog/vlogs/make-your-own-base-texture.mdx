## The Budget Basing Recipe

Today we're making our own basing material. Here's what you need:

- **Spackle/Polyfiller** (~$5, or cheaper in bigger tubs)
- **Baking soda** - Lifetime supply (~$7) - everyone should have this in their hobby kit
- **Cheap paint** - Apple Barrel works great
- **Coffee grounds** - Dried out, cooked in the oven to kill bacteria (technically free!)

For the price of one jar of name brand stuff, you can make a ton of this.

## The Formula

**2 parts material + 2 parts spackle + 1 part paint**

Mix the different materials to get different size textures. Make sure to bust up the baking soda—it's crazy how clumpy it gets.

## The Oops

I wasn't paying attention that my spackle was pink—"goes on pink, dries white." Doesn't really matter since we're adding paint anyway!

## Coffee Texture

Because there's coffee in this, it's going to turn itself brown anyway. The coffee I used was 7-8 years old and hasn't molded.

## Final Adjustments

Added 3 tablespoons of salt and 2 tablespoons of water after mixing. The salt stops any mold from growing and adds another texture type.

## The Comparison

Compared to AK Interactive Ground Texture diorama stuff—it's almost exactly the same! Little bit of difference in the cracking, but pretty spot-on.

Put the hobby back into tabletop gaming and make your own stuff!
