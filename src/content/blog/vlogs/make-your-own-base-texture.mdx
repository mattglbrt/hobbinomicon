## Transcript

Today we're going to make our own basing material. This is like five bucks and they sell it in bigger tubs like big or like our plaster of Paris. Like you can get it in this size for not much more. I just went to the place right by my house and they didn't have any big ones. So we could have saved even more money. So this is five. This is like a lifetime supply of baking soda which is sodium bicarbonate which everybody should have in their hobby kit. This was like seven bucks. And then you don't need nice paints like that—that white and this ink is expensive. You can use the Apple Barrel which is—this stuff's really cheap. So, for like the price of this stuff, that's one jar of what we were using. I mean, that's a great product, too. But when you need it in bulk, this is a better way of doing it.

Actually, what we're going to use is this is old coffee grounds that you dry out when you cook it in the oven for a little bit to kill all the bacteria and make sure that it's actually dry so it doesn't mold. So, this is technically free. So, we're also going to use some of this.

All right. So, we're going to eyeball this because I'm not very well prepared. And the way this works is we're going to do equal parts of like the material to our—this is spackle or Polyfilla if you're not in the United States. Two parts material, two parts spackle, one part paint. And I like these jars because I can like see through them. I'm just going to mix all this up. And this just makes sure we have different size textures. And you want to bust up that baking soda. It's crazy how clumpy it is.

Oh, I was not paying attention that this stuff is pink. I guess in retrospect it says goes on pink. Did not realize that. Goes on pink. It dries white. This will be interesting to see how it works for us. It doesn't really matter just because we're going to put paint in it, but I really have no idea what we're going to get now. I need better—this was the only can of this they had, so I just grabbed it and walked out of the store.

For this one, we'll use—I'm just using white. And I like white because I can paint it. I was going to mix in some browns, too, on the other one. Just because to save us some time, but see that this is pink. We'll start with this. So now I'm just going to mix this up. And I'll be back after I mix it up.

So you can see as we're stirring this, it's already starting to resemble our basing material. And because there's coffee in this, it's going to turn itself brown anyway. I didn't think about that. And I just want to show you. So we've mixed up two jars now. Mostly full, probably like 75% of the way. And I still—like that was off a little cup and I still got a ton left in here and lifetime supply of baking soda and a little bit of paint. So this stuff is way cheaper and it's going to give us the same results. Put the hobby back into tabletop board gaming and make your own stuff.

It looks different. When I got back upstairs, I added 3 tablespoons of salt and 2 tablespoons of water. And the reason I did that is just because I impromptu added that coffee. And that coffee at this point is like seven years old, eight years old and it hasn't molded or anything. But just as an abundance of caution and to add like another type of texture in, I added that salt because that'll stop any mold from growing and just be absolutely sure that no mold is going to grow.

And now here you can see this is compared to that AK Interactive ground texture diorama texture. It's almost exactly the same. There's a little bit difference in that there's cracks in the AK stuff, but it's pretty spot-on.
