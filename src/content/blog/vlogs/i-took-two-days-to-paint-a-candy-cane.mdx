## Keeping the Streak Alive

Don't look too close, but the candy cane's done.

Quick update tonight - it's very cold and I can't sit or stand for prolonged periods due to the vasectomy. But I finished this candy cane. It actually kicked my ass - combination of recovery pain and drinking too much coffee making my hand shake.

Had to repaint it in red twice. Struggled yesterday, but got it done today. Not perfect, but good enough for tabletop.

## Lego Tip: Whatnot App

If you like Lego or think about getting into it, I've been exploring the Whatnot app. At first I thought it was a huge scam - definitely wouldn't buy trading cards from it (lots of sketchy stuff there).

But there are tons of retail stores using Whatnot to liquidate inventory. You can get crazy deals on bulk Lego - I just got hundreds of pieces for literally two or three bucks at a time.

Check out Whatnot for actual physical products. Just avoid the cards.

## D&D Lego System Progress

I'm getting really close to having the D&D Lego system fully fleshed out in my head. Waiting for some bulk orders and parts to come in before I show it off. Then I can build out some layouts and bases and actually demonstrate the ideas I'm thinking.

## The Streak Continues

I've been building KDM models when I can - slowly going because I can't sit upright at my usual hobby area. Should be good to stand and get back in the game by Monday.

Even as cheesy as it is - two days of painting a candy cane still counts. Paint on model. Streak alive.

If I can hobby through RSV, bronchitis, pneumonia, and an emergency room trip, I can do it through this. See you tomorrow.
