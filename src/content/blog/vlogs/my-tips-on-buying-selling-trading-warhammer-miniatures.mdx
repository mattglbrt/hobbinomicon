## The Problem

There's way too much stuff in here. I come in to hobby and spend all my time thinking about what to work on instead of actually doing it. Time for a purge.

## Four Safe Options (North America Focused)

### 1. eBay
Great place, very easy to post auctions. Even with zero feedback, if you post good quality things, people will eventually buy. Just might be a waiting time at first.

### 2. Reddit r/miniswap
Great place to find deals on abandoned projects. Usually people cutting down their piles of shame or giving back to the hobby—not people doing it as a business.

### 3. Game Community Discords and Facebook Groups
Find the trade forum, find someone with what you want, trade or buy outright. Great way to get deals from actual community members.

### 4. Facebook Marketplace (with caveats)
Raw Marketplace is usually scalper territory—overpriced or scammers. You'll get bots hitting you. Stick to the specific groups and communities instead.

## THE GOLDEN RULE

**Only ever use PayPal Goods and Services.** Period. If someone asks you to use something else or Friends and Family, they're scamming you. Period. The end. Don't do it.

That deal that's too good to be true? It is.

## Trading Safely

I actually don't like trades because it's easy to get scammed. Here's the only way I'll trade:

If we're trading $500 armies, I PayPal Goods and Services you $500 plus fees, and you do the same to me. We both ship. Instead of a trade, it's like we both agreed to buy each other's armies for the same price.

That's the only way you're protected. Otherwise they might ship a box of rocks.

## My Selling Process

- Set a Buy It Now price for the longest term
- Accept offers with a minimum I'll accept
- Include shipping in the cost (free shipping)
- Ship Priority so I don't have to buy boxes
- Make sure ONLY the item you're selling is in the photo (people will claim they thought other stuff was included)

Bubble wrap does get expensive—include that cost. If someone wants cheaper shipping, you need to buy a box, so factor that in.

You don't need perfect pictures or lighting. Just clear a spot, take a photo, post it from the eBay app on your phone.
