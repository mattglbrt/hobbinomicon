## Transcript

Today we're attempting time travel to briefly obtain the aionic life and step outside that normal flow of time. We're going to try to sit down and leave our bodies and come back into it with a ton of goblins built. I was not successful and I got through 40 night goblins. I'm somebody who's got to trim all the mold lines. I cannot suffer a mold line to live.

I'm going to tell you my strategy. I think it goes pretty quick. It was like 4 hours spaced throughout the day, I had to keep starting and stopping, which really kind of slowed me down. But if you're able to just like sit down and do it, probably could have done it a lot faster. What I do is I'll clip out all the same parts from each sprue and put them into piles. So like all the heads, all the torsos, all the arms, all the legs, and I'll split like right arm and left arm. And that way you can do all the same part at the same time. And you get that muscle memory. And you also know where to look for the mold slips at. Mold lines are pretty easy to scrape off, but the mold slips, you got to actually like kind of get in there and cut. Just going through. I have a little plastic tub that is sectioned off, a little craft organizer, and I'm just keeping everything organized and sorted.

Tuesday, I'll get the parts for the airbrush in so I can have the airbrush up and running. And that leaves me Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday to get the Call to Arms Warmachine army painted from 0 to 100. So 5 days to do the full army—it's going to be fun. This is going to be a hobby-filled week, which means a lot of late nights, a lot of early mornings. I'm excited. Looking forward to it.
