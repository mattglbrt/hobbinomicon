## Transcript

Hey. Hi. Day five. I woke up ready to paint this thing. But something I didn't think about is you can kind of see that on the tall stones, like the cells in the foam. You can still see it on the side. So, I'm going to take some of this and fix that real quick.

All right. I'm going to try to make it more like actually a vlog. I realized I was trying to do like all these cute angles that also just sucked. And it wasn't really that—I wasn't getting what I wanted from the video, right? So, what I'm doing is I'm dipping my little spatula right here, and I'm just touching it up on the side to fill in these pores. Because you're probably thinking, "That's ridiculous. That's not much of a difference." But if I don't do this, I'm going to look at those pores every time I use this board, and I'm going to say that I was lazy and didn't do it right.

So, now I just have some leftover junk pieces of card stock that I'm going to use to just add some rigidity to these. Ooh, that's tight. Hey, that's pretty good. If it's in frame, it's even better.

More AK Natural Texture for Earth acrylic diorama series. And our trusty spatula. This time with all of our 20mm bases. So, this is what it looks like once it's dry. And you can see like this one's kind of cracking. And I went pretty light on this is why it looks like that. But you could like do two layers or go even thicker. But this is the effect I wanted.

All right, we got all this done today. All these guys, I cleaned out the supports and based them. This guy's pretty much done. I'm going to come back. I'm still like I'm waiting for the skies to dry. So we got to work on the weapons and the hourglass still. I'm waiting for what I did to dry on them right now. But we got everybody based, card sleeves, and we did a lot of work. Like I covered in this so it all looks like stone material and I hit it with a couple more layers of gray primer.
