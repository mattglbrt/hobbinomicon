## Day Five - Ready to Paint (Almost)

Woke up ready to paint, but noticed something I didn't think about—on the tall stones, you can still see the cells in the foam on the sides. Going to fix that real quick.

## The Fix

Using AK Natural Texture for Earth (acrylic diorama series) with a little spatula, just touching up the sides to fill in these pores.

You're probably thinking that's ridiculous—not much of a difference. But if I don't do this, I'm going to look at those pores every time I use this board and say I was lazy and didn't do it right.

## Adding Rigidity

Using leftover junk pieces of card stock to add rigidity to the bases. Simple but effective.

## The Results

Once it's dry, you can see some cracking where I went pretty light. You could do two layers or go thicker, but this cracked effect is what I wanted.

## Today's Progress

- Cleaned out supports and based all these guys
- Covered everything in texture so it all looks like stone material
- Hit it with a couple more layers of gray primer
- Still waiting for scythes to dry to work on weapons and hourglass

Got a lot of work done today!
