## Team Narrative Event

Went to my LGS for a team narrative event game that was a ton of fun. Beautiful board and my beautiful painted Menoth, if I do say so myself.

## The Scenario

I was escorting a cart, trying to get to the middle of the board. Zombies were spawning everywhere trying to stop everyone from reaching the middle.

## The Battle

Spoiler: I could not go the distance. Got bogged down by Orgoth and a ton of zombies.

I was able to wipe out all of Orgoth except for the Butcher. The Butcher ended up going to Armor 29 from all the zombies he was clearing out—he was just unkillable. Even my weapon masters couldn't get through to do any damage.

## The Loss

The other team was able to get their cart to the middle, crack the monolith, and steal it while I was trying to blow it up. I got right there and then the Butcher stepped in and knocked my cart off the road.

We tried a couple assassination runs on the Butcher. Just could not stop him.

We ended up losing, but it was still a ton of fun. Really cool narrative event!

Tomorrow: back to painting.
