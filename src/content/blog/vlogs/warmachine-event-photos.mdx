## Transcript

Today I went to my LGS to do a team narrative event game that was a ton of fun. We had a beautiful board. Obviously my beautiful painted Menoth if I do say so myself. I was the one escorting this cart. I was trying to get to the middle of the board. Spoiler, I could not go the distance. I got bogged down by Orgoth and a ton of zombies.

I was able to wipe out all of Orgoth except for the Butcher. The Butcher ended up going to armor 29 from all the zombies he was clearing out and he was just unkillable. Even my Weapon Masters couldn't even get through to do any damage to him.

So I just included a couple of shots of the board and just how great everything looked. It was a really fun event. Really cool narrative. Essentially zombies were spawning trying to stop me from getting in—or trying to stop everybody really from getting to the middle.

But the other team was able to get their cart to the middle and crack that monolith and steal it while I was trying to blow it up. I got right there and then the Butcher was able to just step in and knock the cart off the road. So, we ended up losing, but it was still a ton of fun. We tried to do a couple of assassination runs on the Butcher. Just could not stop him.

So, thanks for watching. I'll be back tomorrow with some painting.
