## The Board Expansion

Got a tripod and way brighter lights. We finished the board and it turned out so great. I was going to build a frame around it, but instead I decided to build a full table's worth of boards.

So far I've built more of the same concept on three, but on this one I built kind of a platform—a little bit higher. This will be like a foundation for a building or an altar or just different scenes. Not doing them all this mossy. I'll have some where only half is moss and it tapers off. Still want them to move around.

I also cut four that won't even be cobblestoned, and some that are half cobblestone going off into earth.

## The Board Started Telling Its Own Story

Why is it so mossy? Who took the time to build such large bricks? Where did they go now that they're not taking care of them?

These two tentacles coming up out of the ground—what's there? And this stone right here almost looks like a tarp. Like somebody tried to string fabric up to make people think it's a real stone so maybe they step on it and fall down below.

I didn't consciously make these decisions. This happened organically as I lost control of myself making the board. I was taken to another world and this board is a snapshot of what's going on there. What's the name of this place? What's going on?

It's gone beyond just a simple game board for Mollog's Crew into its own project. I'm going to keep exploring it.

## The Last Week Has Been Amazing

I've painted a whole model from bare metal to completely done in a week—something I haven't done in a very long time. And I started painting a commission piece. It's been great.

I have a lot of kids, all under five years old. I thought I had lost the ability to participate in the hobby the way I used to. So much of my life before kids was about tabletop gaming and artwork and creating.

I've realized that doesn't have to be gone. I've found plenty of time to paint, to hobby, and to edit these videos. I've been playing around in Discord, watching other people's videos, and truly feeling like I'm back in the community again.

## Like Being a Kid Again

This feels very much like when I was a kid and we all just made cool stuff and shared it. If we ever played, it was our own versions of D&D, our own made-up Warhammer rules, just having fun.

It wasn't about what it's been about for me the last couple years. I've found something I didn't realize I had lost. It's been way more about the process and the journey and just getting back to the hobby and doing it again.

## More Present

Even if nobody watches, I'm just doing it to keep myself doing it. Now I have so much to look forward to every day.

I'm more present when I'm with the kids, with my wife, because I'm able to actually just be present. I'm not daydreaming about painting or some other project or constantly shopping or looking at models I'd like to paint.

Really, for the last couple months, the only part of the hobby I was participating in was the purchasing part. I was never getting to the painting part. So I've been selling all my pile of shame and backlog.

## The Muse

I had this feeling I was building towards something, but I didn't know what it was. Then I stumbled into these vlogs and this side of YouTube, and it's been fantastic.

This board I was making for Mollog's Crew has taken on its own life. I feel like I've truly tapped into some other world, some other dimension, and I'm channeling that in. I want to build that more and pursue it. I lost myself building that board, and I can't even take credit for making it. That came straight from the muse.

Thank you to everybody watching, everybody I've been talking to on Discord and in the comments. If you're even thinking about doing this vlog thing, definitely do it and comment below so I can go watch it.
