## Transcript

All right, taking the love shack out. Had a great game. 3v3. A little narrative twist about having to go grab some presents and get back to the middle of the board. You can see my very beautifully painted Grymkin. I painted these mechanics for Cygnar. I actually sold this army over to this person a while back. It was fun seeing them again. Hadn't seen them in about a year. A very beautifully painted frogs that I should have got better pictures of.

Here's the Butcher just looking awesome. Really happy with how he turned out. And really just a couple of shots of the campaign. We were pretty much heavy into attrition. It was me, that Grymkin, and Dusk against two Cygnar players and these beautiful frogs. I think both myself and the frogs got totally wiped out. And I think a good chunk of Dusk got totally wiped out. I took a huge amount of both Cygnar players with me though.

Had such a blast playing. It was just really fun. One, I just love the people I play with. The scenario was pretty cool. There was an angry Santa Claus with a bazooka running around. Verger came through this portal and teleported and just straight up got my Rager, but I turned around, got him back with a Juggernaut on the charge on my turn.

Butcher ended up going toe-to-toe with that frog guy right there. He's going to come in shortly right here. So, these two went toe to toe and of course Butcher took him out. Took him out twice actually as just part of the narrative rules where he was a present carrier and then cleared out some other guys and that was my last turn.

Also, the best chicken sandwich I've ever had in my life I had from this KFC tonight and I don't know why it was that good.

Just got back from the most fun I've had playing Warmachine in a long time. I was playing fifth division and I think I might like to play fifth division after how much fun I had today. But I see some boxes by the door and I think that's Dolmenwood.

There's only half of Dolmenwood. So I'm going to wait to unbox it until tomorrow when the rest comes. So, if you're interested in that, that's going to be tomorrow's vlog—unboxing a full complete Dolmenwood Kickstarter.
