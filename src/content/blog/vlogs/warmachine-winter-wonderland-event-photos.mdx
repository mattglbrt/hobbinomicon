## Taking the Love Shack Out

Had a great 3v3 game with a narrative twist—having to grab some presents and get back to the middle of the board.

You can see a very beautifully painted Grymkin. I painted these Mechanics for Cygnar and actually sold this army to this person a while back. It was fun seeing them again—hadn't seen them in about a year. There were also very beautifully painted Frogs that I should have gotten better pictures of.

## Butcher Klaus in Action

Here's the Butcher just looking awesome. Really happy with how he turned out.

## The Battle

We were pretty much heavy into attrition. It was me, Grymkin, and Dusk against two Cygnar players and those beautiful Frogs. I think both myself and the Frogs got totally wiped out, and a good chunk of Dusk too. I took a huge amount of both Cygnar players with me though.

## Highlights

Had such a blast playing. I just love the people I play with. The scenario was pretty cool—there was an angry Santa Claus with a bazooka running around!

Varger came through this portal, teleported, and straight up got my Rager. But I turned around and got him back with a Juggernaut on the charge on my turn.

Butcher ended up going toe-to-toe with that frog character. He took him out—twice actually, as part of the narrative rules where he was a present carrier. Then cleared out some other guys, and that was my last turn.

## Random Note

Also, the best chicken sandwich I've ever had in my life came from KFC tonight. I don't know why it was that good.

## Coming Home

Just got back from the most fun I've had playing Warmachine in a long time. I was playing Fifth Division and I think I might actually play Fifth Division after how much fun I had today.

But I see some boxes by the door... I think that's Dolmenwood! There's only half of it though, so I'm going to wait to unbox it until tomorrow when the rest comes.
