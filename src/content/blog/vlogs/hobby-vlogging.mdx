## The Basing Mystery

Finally coming back to rebasing all these goblins. Super weird because some of them sealed to the base with that baking soda we mixed in like they should have, but others are popping right off.

I've never had this problem to this degree before. Maybe I didn't mix up the baking material enough before putting it on bases and all the baking soda settled to the bottom. Or maybe I just need to add more baking soda.

This is actually going to be pretty quick because half of them are locked into the base properly.

## About Yesterday's Video

I don't know what happened—my audio didn't record, which sucks because painting-wise that was a really good one. But moving on. Got the progress made, didn't want to lose the momentum, didn't want to miss a video upload.

### What the Audio Was Supposed to Say

I started with dark purple, a midtone purple, then magenta—all from Scale Color—just working up in very thin layers. Then I would take it up two steps too high on the highlight and glaze back over that with a midtone to bring it back down and smooth the transition.

When you do that, you can have super deep dark shadows and very bright highlights while keeping crazy contrast, but it still looks smooth in the transition.

## Two Hours of Glazing

I could have sat there glazing all day yesterday. I had 2 hours to paint—did it in the morning before work and family stuff kicked off. That's the longest painting session I've had in 5 years, maybe even longer. Just sat down and painted.

I just got two tongues painted. But it felt good.

### The Problem with Glazing

You have to wait for it to dry. It wasn't too terrible since I had two models to go back and forth from. Really, that's how I paint everything now. I can't turn it off. I'll use other techniques to get to that point, but eventually everything I paint gets to that glazing stage. I just don't know how to paint any other way now.

I'm going to try to change that when we're painting all 90 goblins.

## Today's Progress

I've done about 60 goblins already. Got all the orcs rebased—those guys are good to go. Got all the resin and Forge World stuff washed. Been reading through the Old World rulebook—don't actually know how to play it yet.

### The Commission Work

Made a little more progress on a commission piece. Got the white done—just a little bit of airbrush work and then a lot of glazing. The white to gray is pretty much done. Got to do the shield for him.

### Mangler Squigs

Got the Mangler Squigs looking really cool. Cut in all the black on both of them. I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to paint the goblins on them yet.

Not sure if I'm going to do true metal or non-metal metallic. Probably true metal just because of how much there is to paint. But I'm getting that itch in the skull to do NMM.

## The Base Mold

Made the mold for the bases. I didn't have a ton of silicone left—that's the last of it. Just put some bases in the bottom. Hopefully they'll stay stuck.

The mold is cured! Got to do a little cleanup because some of the base fell apart in it, but even the one that looks questionable looks pretty good. I'm excited.

## Organizing the Space

Making progress on cleaning up and organizing the space. I pulled everything off shelves and put it in stacks in the middle of the room. Now I'm just going through and sorting stuff out.

That's it for today. Quick one. I'll see you tomorrow with hopefully some painting progress.
