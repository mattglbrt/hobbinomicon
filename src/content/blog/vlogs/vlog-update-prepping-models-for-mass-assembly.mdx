## Time Travel Attempt

Attempting time travel to briefly obtain the aionic life and step outside the normal flow of time. Sit down, leave our bodies, come back with a ton of goblins built.

I was not successful. Got through 40 night goblins.

## My Strategy

I'm somebody who's got to trim all the mold lines. I cannot suffer a mold line to live.

Here's the method:
1. Clip out all the same parts from each sprue
2. Put them into piles: all heads, all torsos, all arms (left and right separate), all legs
3. Do all the same part at the same time
4. Get that muscle memory—you know where to look for mold slips

Mold lines are pretty easy to scrape off. Mold slips you actually have to cut.

I use a plastic craft organizer to keep everything sorted.

## The Week Ahead

Tuesday, I get the parts for the airbrush so it's up and running. That leaves me Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday to get the Call to Arms Warmachine army painted from zero to 100.

Five days to do the full army. It's going to be fun. This is going to be a hobby-filled week—lot of late nights, lot of early mornings.

I'm excited. Looking forward to it.
