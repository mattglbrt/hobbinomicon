## Transcript

Okay, I got the worst Trench Crusade battle report you're ever going to watch. But the footage in the game was awesome. We were 3v3 with this dragon in the middle. The goal was to be the team that killed the dragon. And there was some special rules around it where you had to kill the dragon really four times and every time it got a little bit harder to take down.

So, there was a little bit of skirmishes on the flanks. But for the most part, we really just kind of sent everything into the dragon. And I was going to try to send this guy into suicide bomb it, but he never got there.

I think this is New Antioch. His leader—Jay—right in the middle. He tanked this dragon the whole game. One injury. Nice. If he hits—barely hit. Yeah. So it's going to be a—you're not knocked down because you can't be knocked down. He's going to make a three dice injury roll, but they are not—it's still just two highest. And it does ignore armor. Not a great dragon. This is Humsa the Lion.

And I charged my nun in. Nun killed the dragon once, but he came back. And just again, we just really sent everything we had into the dragon in the middle on both sides. The other team actually killed him more than we did, but I got the final shot in from my Communicant. He is the dragon slayer from his perch here in the ruins. Shot through the window and killed the dragon to end the game.
