## The Worst Battle Report Ever

This is going to be the worst Trench Crusade battle report you're ever going to watch. But the footage and game were awesome!

## The Scenario

We were 3v3 with a dragon in the middle. The goal was to be the team that killed the dragon. There were special rules where you had to kill it really four times, and every time it got a little bit harder to take down.

## The Battle

There were some skirmishes on the flanks, but for the most part, we just sent everything into the dragon.

I was going to send my guy in to suicide bomb it, but he never got there. New Antioch's leader Jay tanked this dragon the whole game—absolute unit.

## The Dragon Slayers

My nun charged in and killed the dragon once, but it came back. We just really sent everything we had into the dragon on both sides. The other team actually killed it more than we did.

## The Final Shot

But I got the final shot in from my Communicant. He is the dragon slayer from his perch in the ruins—shot through the window and killed the dragon to end the game.
