## The LED Discovery

I popped the magnet strip off the bottom. Last Christmas I got a baggie of these little LED throwies and had no idea what they were. I've just been sitting on them.

I usually don't like incorporating LEDs into tabletop stuff because it can turn super toyish. But this objective marker is already so ridiculous—you thought it was an abandoned love shack? No, this love shack is in use and the rave is ongoing!

I think this is perfect. The LED changes up the speed rather than constant blinking. This is definitely happening.

## Starting the Metal

We're going to start with Cultist Cloak. I'm doing this pipe first since it looks rubbery, then mixing in some Broadsword Silver for a metallic effect.

## The Metallic Technique

Using Mithril Silver, rust streaks, and Molotow Liquid Chrome. We're going to hit the hard edges up here and all the rivets with the silver. Then go back and only hit some of them with liquid chrome—that'll really add to it.

On the bottom panels, I'm kind of wet dry brushing and just scratching the top. We're only hitting the top parts to create contrast. We don't want any on the underside—we're creating the illusion that it's metal from different angles.

## The Liquid Chrome Warning

You have to be careful using liquid chrome because it's almost so metallic that if you're not careful, it breaks immersion. You suddenly have what looks like real metal and it takes you back to having a metal model.

So I'm using it very sparingly—door rivets, parts of the door edge, some scratches on the bottom. I'm only hitting the top rivets. The ones in shadow I'm actually not going to hit.

## Creating Scratches

Using the raggedy brush to do scratches through there for contrast. Even on parts that won't be seen, just in case.

## The Result

At tabletop level, this thing looks like somebody actually built a little miniature outhouse on the tabletop.

## The Base

I grabbed this rust paint—but I'm actually not going to rust the shack because old iron just gets darker. What I'm going to do is use this rust to paint my base since it's effectively a wet pigment powder.

I'll even go inside the shack with it, and take it up the side of the house a little—just to bring it together. Heat gun evaporates the enamel out.

Boom. If you don't want to add snow, the Love Shack is done! Two nights of 15-minute sessions each gets us to this point.
