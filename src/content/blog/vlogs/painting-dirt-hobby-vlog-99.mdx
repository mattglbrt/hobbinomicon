## The Board is Solid

This thing is solid. Going to be able to flip it over, not worry about any damage to the other side. But now we got to paint—rattle can gray just to give it all a uniform coat.

Tons of textures. Some of it I don't really like. The stones—I think they're just too big. But I think once I get the paint on it'll be better. Over here is pretty bad because I didn't do a good job of blending those stones in. The middle of the board itself looks really good, but we'll see how it looks after paint.

## Mail Day!

Check this out. Six Mage Knight boosters! That's enough for two people to do old school Mage Knight Dungeons booster draft. If I remember right, there's a hero in each and then mage spawn and treasure chest in each.

I got to figure out the draft rules—I'm pretty sure you just run with what you get in your three boosters. I got to find somebody to play with. Maybe I can talk my wife into it.

I got these crazy cheap off Facebook—like $20 total including shipping. Pretty crazy!

## The Painting Process

Going to use Apple Barrel Nutmeg. I don't actually like this brown itself, but I think it's a good midtone. I'm going to mix it right on the board itself.

This is Bronze Flesh Tone—just pick a warm orange. I'm going to dot this on the high areas. And then I have transparent burnt umber ink that I'll put in the low spots and blend it all together.

## The Wet Mud Look

It looks like a mess, but trust me. Big wide brush—this is the biggest brush I got that's easily accessible right now. Keep in mind this is just the first pass. We're going to put multiple layers on here and hit it with a wash, so don't get too worried about it looking like trash right now.

I washed my brush out, got a glove on, going to take a paper towel and just kind of sponge this off.

One thing I do want to point out: this edge right here is where all that medium ballast was that I didn't like. I'm going to keep the paint thick there because it'll harden and thin out a little bit. If I keep it globbed up there, it'll ease that transition more.

## The Final Pass

One final pass of paper towel. I'm just hitting the whole board going in a circle, making it smaller each time just to make sure I get anything that's pulled up.

Right now because the paint's wet, it just looks like mud—which is pretty much what we want. When it dries, it'll look like earth. All this color variation is from our actual paint. It looks like a big pile of poop right now, but that's good. We want it to look like wet mud.

## Day 100 Preview

Tomorrow is day 100—crazy! I'll finish it on day 100. Hit it with an oil wash, wipe off the top layer. Probably heat gun it just enough that I can dry brush on and be done painting wise. I'll paint the rim.

On day 100 it'll be finishing the board, getting all the Crucible Guard based, getting Trench Crusade all based and finished, then all that stuff primed. That way on 101, going hard on painting again. Going to stop with the building, stop with 3D printing for a bit, and just focus on painting again.
