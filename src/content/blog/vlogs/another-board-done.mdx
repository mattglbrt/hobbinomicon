## The Oil is Dry

We're back in the dungeon. The oil is mostly dry today—I mean it's not oil dry, but it's not wet anymore. And I just wanted to show you.

See, we get a bunch of very rich earth—fertile for our imaginations.

## Still Recovering

If you've been following the illness chronicles: the virus that got me sick is gone, but the bronchitis is still here. So it's just rough breathing and talking.

But the board is done!
