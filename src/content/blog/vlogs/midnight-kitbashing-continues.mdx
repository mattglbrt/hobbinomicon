## Where We Are

Added shoulder pads—regular Ogryn shoulder pad kit with the insignia filed off. On one side I cut the whole part out and put another piece in. Sprue-glued them to add texture on the back and beat them up. Gap filled in a few spots.

Also added the other Ogryn foot. Now when he stands flat, the weight of the power fist and mechanical leg is weighing him down, knee bent on the other side. Going to look pretty sick on the base.

## The Cost

If you didn't already have this stuff: Cursed City sprue is expensive, Ogryn kit is like $60, plus the other bits. This conversion is going to be pretty pricey.

## Finding the Character

I was trying to figure out what this guy was going to be when I got a gift from the Ice King—a physical copy of a book I've loved for a long time but only ever had the PDF.

Page 52: Maltek Stalker. He's got a chainsword in the back, mechanical leg, power fist. Mine won't have the Stormbolter thing, but he's going to have this big old chain staff from the Disco Lord.

## Staff Problems

Cut the blade off because the staff was just too thin—didn't look right. Now I've got a Chaos Sorcerer Lord and Terminator staff because this fits a whole lot better.

After a lot of cutting, hacking, and sprue goo, it's in there. Still a little wet but all pinned up.

## The Pose

This is how it'll look on the base. I'll have something resting on the base for that staff to go. Tried to take it all the way to the ground but couldn't get it to work.

Built up the shoulders. The sketch is in. Now it's just refining. The fur is hardened. He's telling a story.

Tomorrow I'll clean this up and get everything primed because the Ice King came through and let me borrow his airbrush.
