## Transcript

Okay, we're back with probably another midnight kitbash. Do we need better lighting? I think we do. Here we go. Here we go. Let's see.

Okay, so this is where we are sitting now. I added some shoulder pads. These are just the regular Ogrun shoulder pad kits. And I filed off the insignia. On this one, I cut this whole part. Like this one still has the lines in it, but on this side I cut it out and just put another piece in and I have sprue glued them just to add a little bit of texture on the back and beat them up. Gap filled here, gap filled there. We're still going to do a little something here. But I also added an Ogrun—the other Ogrun foot. So now when he stands like flat, you can see how it's like the weight of this power fist and his like mechanical leg is like weighing him down and his like knee is bent on the other side. So it's going to look pretty sick once it's on the base. He's like looking this way.

And now this is going to turn into a pretty—honestly it already—like if you didn't already have this stuff like Cursed City sprue is pretty expensive, the Ogrun kit is like 60 bucks, Heresy Kitten Pioneers—like this conversion is going to be pretty expensive.

But also here is a Disco Lord staff. I was trying to think about what I wanted for his weapon and I was trying to figure out what this guy was even going to be. And right on time just got this gift from a great friend, the Ice King. Who I have loved this book for a very long time, but I've never been able to find a physical copy of it. I have only ever had the PDF.

And immediately, I just picked this up today. Immediately, I knew what this guy was going to be. And what he's going to be is on page 52. I have it memorized. Maltek Stalker. And if you can see, he's got chainsword in the back. So, obviously, this guy is tiny. But he's got like the mechanical leg. We're not going to have that storm bolter like thing, but he's got this power fist. But he is going to have this big old chain staff that comes from the Disco Lord.

Okay, so I cut the blade off because the staff was just too thin. It didn't look right. And now I have Chaos Sorcerer Lord on Terminator staff because this just like fits a whole lot better. So, give me a second here.

So, there's still a little bit of cleanup we need to do. But I think I finally after a lot of cutting, a lot of hacking, and a lot of sprue goo, we've got this in there. And it's still a little wet. But I had this all pinned up now. And I think we're there.

So now like this is—it'll look like this on the base. And I'll have something resting on the base for that staff to go. I tried to take it all the way to the ground, but I just couldn't get it to work. You can see I built up the shoulders. New foot. And I'll just clean up some a little bit on the side. But I think we're there. Like the sketch is in. And now it's just going to come down to refining. We've got our fur is hardened. But I think our sketch is in place.

We've got all the stuff lined up nicely and he's telling a story. So this will be another midnight conversion. Tomorrow I'll clean this up and tomorrow I will get all of this stuff actually primed because the Ice King came through and let me borrow his airbrush. So, thanks for watching. See you tomorrow.
