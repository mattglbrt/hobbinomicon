## Framing RPG Maps

Before I junk these tables up again, I've been wanting to get these maps framed. They came pre-creased from being folded in the books, which kind of sucks. You could try to iron them out, but I'm not getting that crazy.

I specifically want to frame these maps of Virginia—where I live—and Moria. The frames I get from Michaels when they do 70-75% off sales. I got these for like $5-10 each.

## The Cheap Framing Method

None of the frames are exact matches, so here's my tip: center the map on the backing sheet, use tiny bits of masking tape on the corners to keep it locked in place. I don't want the tape to be seen, and it'll be easy to remove if I ever decide to do expensive custom framing.

The white bands at top and bottom aren't ideal, but right now it's more important to protect the maps than have them super perfect.

## The 50-Point List is Primed

Random project that's been on my to-do list for months: my 50-point Warmachine list is now primed. Just crowned it black because I'm going to do volumetric style painting—painting in my own values instead of relying on zenithal.

I'll take a picture with light on it and use that as reference for where everything should be. Complete control over lighting.

## Maybe I Fixed My 3D Printer

I was going to start painting today, but thought: let me just get the 3D printer hopefully fixed so I can finish printing everything for Trench Crusade.

I took it completely apart and found the problem. I thought my LCD was out, but there was actually a very thin cured layer of gray resin between the LCD and build plate—couldn't tell because of the lighting. I think I got really lucky and just was being a dumbass.

Even if it's not fully working, half the build plate should be good enough to limp through the rest of Trench Crusade prints.

## Perfect Time to Stop Resin Printing

I'm out of resin. Used my last gloves to clean it. About to be out of alcohol. If I was going to stop resin printing, I'm in a very good spot to stop.

That said, I now have a filament printer I'm borrowing from the Ice King. I'm more interested in that world anyway—at this point I have all the figures I need, but I want terrain and organization things.

## The Golden Demon Goal

Really what this vlog will become is my daily journey of becoming a Golden Demon winning painter. I don't know how many years it's going to take, but that's my main goal.

I'm going to go through models I've painted as a benchmark—this is my current tabletop level, this is my current tryhard level. Then chronicle how I can get to have a chance at least to place at a Golden Demon.

Really, that's where the bulk of my life efforts go: raising children, making enough money to keep raising them, and the rest goes toward being a Golden Demon winning painter.

## The Print Succeeded

Full successful print bed! About to go to bed. Everything is supported, everything's printing. Unless something terrible happens, we're operational again.
