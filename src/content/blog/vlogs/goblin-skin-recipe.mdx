## The Quick Goblin Skin Recipe

Doing a quick one today to show you how I'm going to finish up all this goblin skin really fast.

## The Steps

1. **Base**: Shamrock Green Speed Paint 2.0 over the yellow and black preshade
2. **First Highlight**: Scale Color Alizarin Green
3. **Final Highlight**: Lime Green from Scale Color, hit the nose

Honestly, if you were super duper in a hurry, you could probably stop after just the Shamrock Green. But the Scale Color highlights really make it pop.
