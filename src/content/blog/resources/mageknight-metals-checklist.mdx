This checklist is a work in progress as I compile the complete list of Mage Knight metal miniatures.

Iron Wind Metals produced this Mage Knight Metal series using the Ral Partha brand name. It contained metal figures created for WizKids Games's Mage Knight game. Ral Partha Europe also produced these.

Because of this the figures come in multiple types of differently branded blisters, so I will organize the lists like that so you know what to look for packaging wise.
