# Shakti's Strategy & Tactics Guide

*Copyright © 2000, 2001, Warlord Shakti*

## Introduction

Mage Knight is a new and unique game in many ways. The rules are relatively simple for a miniatures game, making it very easy to learn, but mastering the game is not an easy task. The tactics are numerous and some are fairly complex, and the strategic considerations are deeper than even those for chess.

This guide first explains the **basic tactics** that arise from the properties of the game. Tactics are the specific techniques you use to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves during the course of a game, and to achieve short-term objectives. Knowing when and how to apply tactics is what separates experienced players from newbies, and is also a prerequisite to understanding strategy.

The guide next explains the **strategy** of the game. Strategy is your general gameplan at the start of the game, and the thing that guides your movement and placement decisions during the opening and middle game when you still both have a lot of figures on the table with a lot of options and complexity. A keen understanding of strategy is what distinguishes the strongest players.

## Special Terms

Rather than bog down the main flow of this document, special terms are defined separately. Key terms you'll encounter:

- **Tempo**: The measure of attack timing advantage
- **First-striker**: The figure that lands the first attack in a skirmish
- **Relative power**: A statistical measure comparing two figures' combat effectiveness
- **Blocker**: A figure used to shield others from ranged attacks or absorb enemy actions

---

## The Hidden Laws

These "laws" aren't really hidden so much as they're just not that obvious. Just as much as your tactical decisions must take into account the written rules of the game, so must your tactics take into account these not-well-known rules of the game.

### Law 1: Dice Roll Probabilities

Knowing the probability of rolling specific numbers can be very helpful in determining whether or not to make a particular attack, capture, or breakaway attempt.

#### Attack or Capture Rolls (2D6)

| Need to Roll | Probability |
|--------------|-------------|
| 2 (critical miss) | 3% |
| 3 or better | 97% |
| 4 or better | 92% |
| 5 or better | 83% |
| 6 or better | 72% |
| 7 or better | 58% |
| 8 or better | 42% |
| 9 or better | 28% |
| 10 or better | 17% |
| 11 or better | 8% |
| 12 (critical hit) | 3% |

#### Breakaway Rolls (1D6)

| Need to Roll | Probability |
|--------------|-------------|
| 4 or better | 50% |
| 2 or better | 83% |

### Law 2: The Off-Square Rule

New players often struggle with line of fire (LOF) when dealing with ranged combat attacks. People quickly pick up on blocking LOF with a figure's base, but don't realize how much coverage a single figure's base really provides.

**The key insight:** A single figure can block LOF to TWO figures behind it, both placed side-by-side instead of staggered "conga-style." Not only that, but that single figure can block the LOF from TWO firers that are in base contact.

The trick is that the two groups must be rotated "off-square" relative to each other. Even if rotated by only a minuscule amount, geometrically speaking LOF is blocked—but to the naked eye the two groups may seem perfectly square.

**Practical application:** If your intent is that two groups are off-square, verbally declare it. According to the Off-Square Rule, your intent is that LOF is blocked to both targets.

### Law 3: The Mobility Rule

The importance of having as many options as possible is often overlooked by novice players. Mage Knight's movement mechanics are unusual—you don't have to move within pre-established lanes or in specific increments. There are literally an infinite number of positions you can move a figure to.

**The Mobility Rule:** You have the most options when a figure is near the center of the play area. Options are reduced as figures near edges, corners, or hindering terrain.

Between players of high skill, skirmishes and entire games are won and lost on the basis of superior maneuvering. The side that maintains the best overall mobility has the most options for maneuvering.

### Law 4: Relative Power

It's not always easy to predict which of two figures is more likely to win a fight. There's a statistical way to measure this using four numbers:

1. **Average attack value**: Mean of all attack values on the combat dial
2. **Average defense value**: Mean of all defense values
3. **Average damage value**: Mean of all damage values
4. **Health**: Total damage clicks before dying

#### Calculating Relative Power

**Step 1 - Determine relative hit percentage:**
Compare average attack vs. opponent's average defense, then look up the probability.

**Step 2 - Determine relative damage:**
Multiply relative hit percentage × average damage value.

**Step 3 - Determine relative power:**
Divide opponent's health by your relative damage (round up).

**Example: Blue Amotep Gunner vs. Yellow Troll Artillerist**

*Gunner stats:* 5 attack, 12 defense, 1.6 damage, 7 health
*Artillerist stats:* 6 attack, 12 defense, 2.2 damage, 6 health

- Gunner needs 7+ to hit (58%), relative damage = 0.9, relative power = **7 attacks to kill**
- Artillerist needs 6+ to hit (72%), relative damage = 1.6, relative power = **5 attacks to kill**

The Artillerist isn't guaranteed to win—the difference is only 2. If the Gunner can somehow get 2 extra attacks, it's an even fight. With 3 extra attacks, the Gunner should statistically win.

**This is where tactical maneuvering and harassers win the day.**

## The 10 Basic Maxims

Being able to quickly evaluate tactical opportunities and threats is a basic skill every player must learn. Memorize these maxims and use them as a mental checklist.

### Maxim 1: All Skirmishes Boil Down to Single Fights

Mage Knight is turn-based with limited actions per turn. Even if 10 attackers charge 10 defenders, only a small number of figures will actually be swinging at each other in any given turn.

**Application:** Gauge the probable outcome by mentally pairing the toughest attackers versus toughest defenders, in order, and predicting each individual fight outcome. Repeat with "survivors" until one side is eliminated.

### Maxim 2: All Skirmishes Hinge on Your Heavy Muscle

Never forget that harassing units and support units don't do the actual fighting. If your harassers get opportunistic potshots, great—but never depend on them.

**Always evaluate a potential skirmish first using only heavy muscle on both sides.** Ignore harassers and support completely. If you don't win that scenario, stop and look for other targets or bring additional forces.

### Maxim 3: Support Units Must Die First

If your opponent has support units in range to support his heavy muscle, that's an overwhelming advantage. If you can't counter-balance with your own support, **focus on removing the problematic support unit first.**

It's worth sacrificing units at a victory point deficit if you can make up the lost points by successfully taking down your original targets once their support is removed.

### Maxim 4: The First-Striker Usually Wins Between Equal Power

When two units' relative power is exactly the same, **the one who gets the first strike will win** because they maintain a 1-tempo lead throughout.

#### Rules of Thumb for First-Strike Advantage

**Between two fresh units:**
- First striker wins if equal power
- Even race if first striker has 1 less relative power
- First striker loses if 2+ less relative power

**Between fresh first striker and fatigued opponent:**
- Same as above

**Between fresh first striker and pushed opponent:**
- Same as above

## Overcoming Defender's Tempo Advantage

The first skirmish tactics you must master are how to overcome the natural tempo advantage that defending forces have. Because most units cannot move into attacking range AND attack on the same turn, defenders generally have a strong advantage—fresh defenders can usually dish out two attacks before attackers can dish out even one.

Since most tournament-worthy armies do at least 3 damage per successful attack, this two-tempo advantage is a big deal.

### Attacking with Tempoed Forces

Attack with figures that have Charge, Bound, or have been tossed via Magic Levitation. This is the most preferable way to initiate a skirmish because attackers get the first real attack as if they were fresh units.

**Cost:** Less flexible army construction. Charge/Bound figures are rare, and Magic Levitation is very rare.

### Attacking with Blocking Maneuvers

Use low-cost figures to attack first as a diversion, with your main force positioned behind to prevent LOF from ranged defenders.

**Requirements:**
- Blockers must be a legitimate threat (can't be ignored)
- Blockers should be very low-cost OR tough enough to escape after engagement
- Main force must be strong enough to win even at moderate tempo disadvantage
- Main force must start just out of range of defenders
- Main force must be faster than defending force
- Main force must start with no action counters

**The concept:** Force defenders to use tempo attacking blockers. As soon as they slap down an action counter, move your main force into range. Defenders now start next turn with an action counter—if they attack immediately, they must push.

### Attacking with Flanking Maneuvers

Run an ultra-fast unit around and behind defenders to threaten from the rear. This forces defenders to waste a move action spinning or repositioning.

**Key insight:** The timing of your moves is critical. Both blocking and flanking force defenders to use an action token dealing with a diversion, allowing your main force to get into range with a tempo advantage.

---

## Attacking Ranged Units

Newbies often falsely believe ranged units are impossible to approach. The key is performing specific distraction maneuvers with harassers so attackers can safely get into combat range.

### Using Blockers

Brute-force rushes are usually inefficient. Use a single expendable (or very tough) blocker to sneak in the troops that can take the ranged unit out.

### Using Flankers

Fly, levitate, or move a harassing ranged attacker to the side or rear of an enemy, behind their front arc, to snipe and force them to spend an action turning. This allows your main force to safely move into attacking range.

**A two-pronged threat** can effectively manipulate an enemy ranged formation into severe disadvantage. It's all in the timing.

### Using Flame

Against strong ranged formations with a key figure surrounded by protectors, Flame/Lightning can be a formation breaker. If the key figure is in base contact with any outlying defender within your combat range, you can damage the key figure by attacking the defender with Flame/Lightning.

---

## Endgame Tactics

### Corner Defense

**Tactical observation:** Put a ranged figure in a corner and he becomes at least three times stronger. There's no way to slip behind him to manipulate action counters, and you can put at most two units in base contact.

**Generalization #1:** If you're down to one ranged unit, haul for a 90-degree corner (L-shaped blocking terrain or table corner).

**Generalization #2:** Keep at least one ranged unit alive until endgame. If you have no ranged units versus opponent's single ranged unit in a corner, it's almost impossible to kill him.

**Generalization #3:** The best tactic against corner ranged units is to CAPTURE, not kill. Use a blocker to get two units safely in range for a final rush. Make sure they have only one action counter after the rush so both can push and make capture attempts.

---

## Capturing and Avoiding Capture

### Effective Capture Tactics

Use units with **Quickness** to do capturing. After capturing, you can move the captor and captive each turn in addition to normal actions. The red Shade is ideal—his 9 attack yields reasonable capture roll percentages.

### Foiling Capture Attempts

When an opponent makes base contact with a critical figure, running often doesn't work—they can catch up.

**Better method:** First run another of your figures into base contact with the figure attempting to capture you. THEN make your breakaway roll. Now your opponent must also make a breakaway roll to follow, improving your chances to escape.

---

## The Fine Art of Magic Levitation

- Use levitation to slingshot captives back towards your starting area
- Use two levitators to multiple-slingshot heavies or harassers practically anywhere on the board
- Remember: a levitated character can still perform an action (levitate a Shockwave attacker into a dense enemy group!)

**Example tactic:** Use a Magus to Levitate a tough guy, then use the tough guy's move to close into opponent's shooters/support. Best timing: after opponent's Golem wall has pushed. You move 10" from levitation PLUS the figure's movement. The charge into their rear alters the Golem march before they close on your Magus.

---

## The Fine Art of Necromancy

Keep a healer next to your Grave Robber or Necromancer to heal revived creatures to the strength you need.

### Yellow Skeleton Tactics

Often underrated, the Yellow Skeleton is actually very useful:

1. **10 point cost** - Easy to squeeze into any army
2. **Mandatory Weapons Mastery** - Worst case is same as default damage
3. **Attack 10** - Only needs 5+ to hit average defense 15, and 7+ to capture (better than 50/50)

**Best usage:** Use obstructing terrain for cover while approaching. Use faster units to pin enemies and prevent firing before charging the Skeleton in. Once in base contact, **push him on your next turn**—he won't last long enough to wait. Try to capture if you have a clear path out, otherwise use WM.

If killed, bring back with Necromancer and try again. When using Necromancer, wait until he's in base contact, then bring Skeleton back in contact with both Necro and opponent as first action, attack with Skeleton as second action.

### Push-Spawn Tactics

Push-spawns (Werecreatures, Worms) are ultra-prime with Necromancy bringing them back at peak stats.

**Pitfall to avoid:** Don't push these guys to get into combat if opponent does 3+ damage per hit. One hit and your tough werebear gets emasculated.

**Better approach:** Time your push-spawn to be at prime stats AFTER taking the first hit from the 'biggie' they're fighting. Then when that werebear smacks back for 4 damage, it hurts.

**Warning:** All push-spawns are fairly easy to capture—think twice before sending them on kamikaze missions alone.

## Using Terrain

### Hindering Terrain

### Blocking Terrain
*(Content to be expanded)*

### Elevated Terrain

With irregular-shaped elevated terrain (small hills with deep canyons), you can play cat-and-mouse with ranged attackers on the hilltop. Put a canyon and part of the hill between you and the firer—the LOF crossing the play surface in the canyon, then the small bit of elevated terrain you're hiding behind, blocks LOF.

**This makes a very strong position for figures with Magic Blast.**

### Water Terrain

This is where drowning captives becomes relevant.

## Strategy

Strategy is your general game plan and being able to recognize and manipulate tension and imbalance. Understanding strategy versus tactics separates newbies from veterans.

### Core Strategic Principles

**You must have a main plan and backup plans.** Highly specialized strategies are risky—if disrupted, you've lost. Flexible strategies pay off in the long run. Always ask what you would do if your opponent neutralizes a critical piece.

**You must pay attention to your opponent's apparent strategy.** Sometimes the best move is not to advance your own strategy but to hinder your opponent's.

### Positional Play

Understanding subtle points like:
- Evaluating strategic imbalances ("the position")
- Gaining the initiative (making threats your opponent must respond to)
- Deciding when to pursue tactical objectives versus improving strategic imbalances

---

## Army Composition

### Basic Principles

A well-balanced army usually includes:
- **Heavy muscle** - Your main damage dealers
- **Support units** - Healers, enhancers
- **Harassers** - Cheap, fast figures for disruption
- **Ranged units** - For flexibility and control

### Action Economy

Consider how many actions your army needs versus how many you have per turn. Too few figures means wasted actions; too many means some figures never act effectively.

### Point Efficiency

Evaluate figures not just by their raw stats but by their efficiency relative to their point cost. A 30-point figure that can tie up a 100-point figure for multiple turns is extremely efficient.

---

## Figure Evaluation

### Combat Effectiveness

Use the relative power calculations to compare figures mathematically. But also consider:
- Special abilities and when they activate
- Dial depth (how many clicks before becoming ineffective)
- Speed and mobility
- Synergy with other figures in your army

### Role Assessment

Identify what role each figure plays best:
- **Frontline fighters** - High defense, good attack, solid damage
- **Assassins** - High speed, good attack, can reach support units
- **Anvils** - High health, can absorb damage and tie up enemies
- **Support** - Healing, enhancement, command abilities
