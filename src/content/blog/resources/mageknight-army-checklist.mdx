# WarLord H0urg1ass's Army Checklist

Many beginning and advanced players alike have trouble remembering all of the little nuances of the game. To get the most use out of this checklist, build your armies while referencing either this page or a printed copy.

Most players will not be able to place a check beside every box listed. This is only intended to be a reminder sheet of things that you may have forgotten while building your army. In fact, I haven't constructed an army yet that used all of the items.
