## The Phase Elf

Triste is a young phase elf whose presence always seems to drift a half-step ahead of anyone trying to understand her. She moves like moonlight slipping through branches, soft in voice and impossible to pin down. Her people walk the thin places of the world, and Triste carries that same quiet strangeness, as if she is listening to things no one else can hear.

## A Seeker of Experience

Curiosity rules her life. She seeks experience for its own sake, not gold or renown. Old ruins, whispered legends, forgotten relics, and reckless journeys appeal to her far more than comfort or safety. For reasons she has never explained, she often chooses to bring a companion along, tugging him into danger with nothing more than a smile and a spark in her eye.

## Garrin Vosk

That companion is Garrin Vosk, a grizzled hunter and former soldier whose past has been carved into him by hard years and harder choices. Garrin is steady, practical, and slow to trust, but Triste disarmed him from the start. Somewhere along their shared travels, his loyalty grew into something deeper. He has not spoken of it, and she has never asked, but their closeness is evident in quiet glances and the way they move in step without thinking.

> Whether she returns his feelings remains a mystery. Her affection is gentle and constant, but her inner thoughts stay carefully veiled.

## The Hidden Artifact

Recently Triste learned of an artifact hidden deep within the Forest of Ruhar. Something about it calls to her in a way she refuses to name. She keeps this secret to herself. Instead of revealing her true interest, she discovers that a traveling mage is also searching for the relic and is looking to hire protection for the journey. Triste convinces Garrin to take the job, offering nothing more than the promise of a curious path ahead. Garrin agrees because when Triste asks, he rarely says no.

Now the three of them walk beneath the tall boughs of Ruhar. The mage mutters over his notes, Garrin keeps a hunter's watch, and Triste guides them with unobtrusive nudges whenever the forest seems to shift around them. She knows they are drawing closer to what she seeks.

## A Fateful Encounter

Their path changes when they encounter two figures in a woodland clearing: a dwarf with the look of someone carrying old burdens, and beside him a small wanderer gazing upward at the sunlight with childlike wonder. Thorek and Rollo seem as surprised as anyone, though Triste feels a faint stir in the air, as though the world itself has begun stitching their stories together.

She steps forward with her usual serene smile, Garrin only a half-step behind her, ready for whatever comes next.

## The Miniature

The miniature representing Triste was a gift—its maker unknown.
