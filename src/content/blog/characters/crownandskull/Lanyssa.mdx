## Background
Lanyssa is the current leader of **The Last Watch**, the final generation of elves descended from the ancient starborne colony that first landed in the Far North thousands of years ago. Though she lists **Rivergate** as her hometown, this is only a **cover identity** used by the Last Watch when interacting with established civilization. Her true birthplace is the Northern Enclave, an isolated and warded settlement built around fragments of the original elven outpost.

Raised from childhood to inherit the responsibility of her bloodline, Lanyssa devoted her life to studying fragments of the ancestors’ arcane archives—crystal slates, mnemonic chants, broken data tablets, and ritual codes passed down for generations. From these remnants she learned the truth of her people’s origin and the prophecy surrounding Varinax, the primordial dragon whose awakening marks the end of an age.

Lanyssa was chosen to lead not out of ambition, but inevitability. She is the only one who holds the full ritual knowledge required to begin **The Final Hunt**, the last-ditch effort to stop Varinax’s world-ending cycle.

## Personality
Lanyssa is calm, disciplined, and deeply introspective. She rarely raises her voice, and she almost never displays fear. Her mind operates on two levels: the tactical present and the cosmic long-view inherited from her ancestors. This makes her seem distant at times, but to her companions she is steadfast, loyal, and quietly protective.

Her flaw of **Grudge** manifests as a relentless, unwavering memory of wrongs—especially toward those who threaten her mission or her companions. Her flaw of **Employed** reflects her life-long service to the lineage’s duty: she does not work for a person, but for a prophecy.

Her two bonded snow leopards, **Benkei** and **Sasha**, are her emotional grounding—her closest friends and constant shadows.

## Appearance
Lanyssa bears the traits of the northern bloodlines: pale skin marked with faint frost-like patterns, long silver-white hair, and cold blue eyes that glow subtly when she channels winter magic. She dresses in furs and layered leathers designed for deep snow travel, with her ancestral greatsword **Sorrow** always close at hand.

Her presence brings a subtle chill to the air. When she casts, snowflakes form in her breath and the temperature drops sharply.

## Role in the Story
As the **primary spellcaster** and **leader of the Last Watch**, Lanyssa’s magic shapes the battlefield with winter storms and freezing blasts. She interprets the ancient signs tied to Varinax and guides the group’s movements based on her understanding of the prophecy.

She alone carries the encoded ritual that will initiate **The Final Hunt**—a fate she does not expect to survive, though she keeps this truth hidden from the others.

Her snow leopard companions provide additional speed, flanking potential, and tactical control in combat.
