## Background
Vyr is the **first-born** of the twin brothers, raised in the **Hidden Northern Enclave** where the descendants of the original starborne elves maintain their secret vigil. While he lists **Rivergate** as his hometown, this is only a functional cover identity used by the Last Watch during their operations among mortals.

Where Mordryth was shaped into the Watch’s shield, Vyr was molded into its **hands**—the craftsman, healer, and problem-solver who keeps the others alive between battles. From childhood, he showed patience, precision, and a talent for understanding how things fit together: armor plates, broken bones, ancient mechanisms, and improvised survival solutions.

The enclave’s elders taught him the fading art of their ancestors: the techniques for shaping metal with near-magical precision, methods for stitching wounds alongside ritual chants, and the importance of maintaining the gear needed for the Final Hunt. Vyr took to these teachings naturally, becoming indispensable to the Watch long before he reached adulthood.

## Personality
Vyr is calm, meticulous, and quietly insightful. While Mordryth is stoic, Vyr is warm in a reserved way—someone who speaks softly but holds the group together with practical, dependable care. He reads people as easily as he reads broken gear, noticing stress cracks in armor, relationships, and morale alike.

His flaw of **Employed** reflects the lifelong service expected of him, and his flaw of **Grudge** emerges slowly but deeply—he rarely loses his temper, but once someone harms his family, he never forgives.

Despite his martial training, Vyr dislikes unnecessary violence. He would rather repair than destroy, heal than harm. But when the Final Hunt approaches, he fights without hesitation.

## Appearance
Vyr shares his twin’s height and athletic build, though his demeanor is less imposing. Where Mordryth looks like a warrior carved from stone, Vyr resembles a sculptor or craftsman—his hands steady, his movements precise.

His armor is always immaculately maintained, repaired with subtle enhancements only he can craft. His scale vest is decorated with runes from their forgotten starborne heritage, etched during quiet moments of reflection. His eyes carry a thoughtful, focused intensity.

## Role in the Story
Vyr serves as the **support backbone** of the Last Watch, filling multiple essential roles:

- **Party Medic:** Keeps allies alive through Medical skill and calm precision  
- **Armorer & Smith:** Maintains, repairs, and improves armor using ancient enclave methods  
- **Weapon Smith & Tinker:** Uses his Repair skill and tools to keep gear functional  
- **Utility Specialist:** Provides fire, shelter, climbing safety, and tactical items  
- **Secondary Defender:** His Resist skill ensures he survives long enough to help others  

In the Final Hunt, Vyr’s role is less about glory and more about endurance. He is the one who keeps the party alive long enough to face Varinax herself.

## Notable Abilities
- **Battlemaster:** Skilled in tactics and disciplined combat.
- **Armorer (8):** Expert in crafting and maintaining armor.
- **Medical (8):** Treats wounds and stabilizes allies.
- **Repair (8):** Fixes weapons, gear, and improvised tools.
- **Resist (8):** Durable and reliable in battle.

## Equipment Highlights
- **Great Sword:** His primary weapon in combat.
- **Scale Vest:** Rare, expertly crafted armor.
- **Greaves:** Reinforced protection for his legs.
- **Craftsman's Tools:** Hammer, spanner, and bits for repairs.
- **Medical Supplies:** Carries poultices, bandages, and herbal mixtures.
- **Utility Gear:**
  - Climbing Gear  
  - Flint & Steel  
  - Sack of Bearings  
  - Cold Weather Fur  

## Combat Style
Vyr engages in combat with careful calculation rather than brute force:
- Uses his Resist skill to stay standing in dangerous situations  
- Supports allies from mid-line positions  
- Fights primarily to protect rather than to kill  
- Deploys bearings to hinder enemy approaches  
- Stays mobile and adaptable  

His goal is always the same: protect the Watch, preserve their strength, and ensure they can continue the mission.

## Out of Combat Role
Vyr’s true value shines outside of immediate danger:
- Repairs and upgrades gear  
- Treats injuries and stabilizes the wounded  
- Maintains armor and weapon integrity  
- Builds fires, shelters, and survival tools  
- Solves logistical and environmental challenges  

Without Vyr’s constant maintenance, the Last Watch would have fallen apart long ago.

## Relationships
Vyr’s closest bond is with his twin brother **Mordryth**, with whom he shares a lifetime of training and unspoken understanding. While Mordryth is the shield, Vyr is the structure that holds it together.  

His support role creates natural closeness with all members of the Last Watch—he has mended their wounds, fixed their gear, and kept them alive more times than they can count.

He is, quite literally, the glue that keeps the party functioning.
