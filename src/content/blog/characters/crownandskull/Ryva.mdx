## Background
Ryva is the **youngest** of the Last Watch—born decades after her companions, though still older than most civilizations will ever know. She was raised in the **Hidden Northern Enclave**, the secretive home of the descendants of the ancient starborne elves. Like the rest of the Watch, her listed hometown of **Rivergate** is nothing more than a cover identity.

From childhood, Ryva showed an unusual mixture of raw physical talent and reckless determination. While her elders urged caution and discipline, Ryva pushed boundaries, trained past exhaustion, and sought challenges far beyond her age. Her fierce independence earned both concern and admiration from the enclave’s instructors.

The prophecy of **Varinax** was stamped into her training from the moment she could stand. Yet, unlike the others—who carry the prophecy like a burden—Ryva carries it like a call to prove herself worthy of her lineage. The Final Hunt frightens her, but more than that, it drives her.

## Personality
Ryva is bold, energetic, and irrepressibly determined. Where Lanyssa is patient and thoughtful, and Cylena is precise and grounded, Ryva is the beating heart of the Watch—restless, hungry for achievement, and eager to demonstrate that she belongs beside legends.

Her flaw of **Grudge** burns hotter in her than in the others, turned into fuel for her ambition. Her flaw of **Employed** reflects a unique tension: she wants to prove herself on her own terms, even as she follows the path laid out for her.

She admires Lanyssa, competes fiercely with Cylena, and looks up to the twins—especially Mordryth, whose quiet strength she secretly tries to emulate.

## Appearance
Ryva is lean, athletic, and radiates coiled energy. Her silver hair is often tied in high braids that whip behind her as she fights, and her sharp violet eyes crackle with intensity.

She wears lighter armor than the others, favoring speed over bulk. Her most striking feature, however, is her weaponry: **two enormous greatswords**, custom-forged to be lightweight and perfectly balanced. The blades are etched with runes from the enclave’s smithing tradition—marks of her training and her pride.

She cuts a silhouette that is impossible to forget.

## Role in the Story
Ryva is the **premier damage dealer** of the Last Watch. Her **dual-wielding greatsword style** is unique even among elven warriors—a blend of raw strength, impossible speed, and fluid precision. She does not just survive the frontline; she dominates it.

Her eagerness to prove herself drives her into danger, but also gives the Watch a fearlessly aggressive edge. In battles tied to Varinax’s influence, Ryva often serves as the lightning bolt that breaks enemy lines before they can regroup.

## Notable Abilities
- **Battlemaster**: Disciplined in advanced combat techniques.
- **Supreme Dual Wielder**: Dual Wield 12—letting her wield two greatswords with lethal efficiency.
- **Muscle (8)**: Raw physical power to drive her aggressive style.
- **Evade (7)**: Dodges blows through agility over armor.

## Equipment Highlights
- **Two Custom Greatswords** (D10 each)
  - Effects: Lightweight, Balanced  
  - Specially modified to be dual-wieldable despite their size
- Light armor pieces to maintain speed
- Cold-weather gear for northern expeditions
- Minimal tools—Ryva travels light

## Combat Style
Ryva’s fighting style is breathtakingly aggressive:
- Swings two massive blades with fluid precision  
- Executes rapid multi-strike combinations  
- Uses evasion rather than brute defense  
- Relies on momentum, positioning, and fearless initiative  
- Turns battles through sheer overwhelming pressure  

Few enemies survive long enough to understand her style. None forget it.

## Relationships
Ryva deeply respects her companions, though she hides her softer feelings behind bravado. She looks to Lanyssa for guidance, challenges Cylena in friendly rivalry, and reveres the twin brothers—especially Mordryth—as models of strength and discipline.

She pushes herself constantly because she feels she must earn her place among legends.  
Her family is the Last Watch, and she intends to make them proud.
