## Background
Though they use the city as a base of operations, Cylena—like the rest of the Last Watch—was not born there. She originates from the Northern Enclave, the secretive settlement maintained by descendants of the ancient starborne elves. From a young age, she was trained in scouting, survival, and long-range combat, destined to serve as the second to Lanyssa.

Where Lanyssa studied arcane archives, Cylena studied the land itself. She learned to read broken branches, shifting winds, and the subtle patterns of creatures that sensed disturbances long before mortals noticed them. Her role in the Last Watch arises from a simple truth: Varinax leaves ripples, and Cylena is the one who finds them first.

Her mastery with the bow is not the result of raw talent alone. It comes from generations of disciplined training, passed down in a lineage that understood stealth and precision were the only advantages mortals could have against cosmic predators.

## Personality
Cylena is sharp, observant, and dry-witted. She is less solemn than Lanyssa but no less devoted. Her loyalty runs deep, forged through shared duty and the unspoken understanding that their line is nearing its final chapter.

She carries her flaws—**Employed** and **Grudge**—as part of her identity. Her entire life has been service, and she has little patience for those who question the Last Watch’s purpose. Once someone earns her mistrust, they rarely regain it.

Despite her serious exterior, she has a protective streak for the younger or less experienced members of the team. 

## Appearance
Cylena moves with the effortless quiet of a snow cat, every step calculated and light.

She wears durable climbing leathers layered beneath a rare scale vest, and her cloak blends seamlessly into shadow and snowfall. Her custom longbow is almost always in hand, its runic patterns faint reminders of their starborne ancestry.

## Role in the Story
As the primary scout, anged specialist, and second-in-command, Cylena guides the party through hostile terrain, identifies threats long before conflict begins, and coordinates tactical positioning. 

Cylena also serves as Lanyssa’s confidante and counterbalance, grounding the group when the leader’s burdens grow heavy. Should Lanyssa fall, Cylena is the one entrusted to assume command and continue the Final Hunt.
