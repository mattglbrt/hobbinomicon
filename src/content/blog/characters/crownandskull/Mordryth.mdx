## Background
Mordryth was born in the **Hidden Northern Enclave**, the secret settlement where the descendants of the first starborne elves have survived in isolation for millennia. He and his twin brother **Vyr** were raised as guardians from their earliest days—two halves of a singular purpose, shaped by ritual combat training, survival lessons, and an unyielding expectation of sacrifice.

Though he lists **Rivergate** as his hometown, this is only a cover identity. Mordryth has spent little of his life in cities; his childhood unfolded among frozen cliffs, ancient ruins, and the cold halls where the prophecy of **Varinax** was taught in hushed voices. His training was brutal, even by enclave standards—he was always meant to become the **shield** of the Last Watch.

Mordryth does not question the duty passed down through generations. He does not doubt the prophecy. He does not fear the Final Hunt.

He was born to stand in front of danger, and he embraces that purpose entirely.

## Personality
Mordryth is stoic, patient, and resolute. He rarely speaks unless necessary, and when he does, his words carry weight rather than volume. He has the temperament of a mountain—immovable, steady, and impossible to intimidate.

His flaw of **Employed** reflects the life-long service he was born into: he does not choose his battles, he fulfills the lineage’s will. His flaw of **Grudge** is quiet but sharp; once someone betrays his trust or harms his companions, he never forgets.

Despite his intimidating presence, Mordryth has a softer side rarely seen outside his inner circle. He looks after the younger members of the Watch, and he shares a deep, unshakeable bond with his twin, Vyr.

## Appearance
Mordryth is a towering figure even by elven standards, with broad shoulders and the hardened physique of a lifelong warrior. His hair is long and dark, usually tied back for practicality. His face bears old scars—proud reminders of battles survived during the Watch’s long, secret vigil.

He wears **full heavy armor**, each piece crafted by enclave smiths from ancestral designs. His helm is distinctive, its angular crest designed to draw enemies’ attention away from his allies. The chest plate is thick and unyielding, while his greaves are built for climbing frozen cliffs as often as marching to war.

## Role in the Story
As the **primary tank and battlefield defender**, Mordryth positions himself between danger and his allies. His **Battlemaster** core ability allows him to manipulate enemy movement, absorb devastating blows, and turn losing battles into held lines.

He is the Last Watch’s anchor—its shield, its bulwark, and its first line of defense against threats tied to Varinax. In the Final Hunt, he expects to die so the others may finish the task. He has accepted this with calm certainty.

## Notable Abilities
- **Battlemaster**: Expert in controlling enemy movement and protecting allies.
- **Exceptional Resistance**: Resist 12—nearly unmatched durability.
- **Expert Climber**: Climber 10 makes him adept at scaling cliffs and ruined structures.
- **Survivalist**: Survival 8 ensures the group endures harsh environments.

## Equipment Highlights
- **Great Sword**: His reliable two-handed weapon.
- **Full Heavy Armor**:
  - **Helm**: Draws enemy attention.
  - **Chest Plate**: Maximum protection but restricts stealth and prevents swimming.
  - **Greaves**: Reinforced armored shins.
- **Climbing Gear**: Essential for northern expeditions.
- **Caltrops**: Tactical tools for controlling the battlefield.
- **Rope (50')**: Useful for climbing, rescues, or tactical maneuvers.
- **Cold Weather Fur**: Keeps him warm during northern operations.

## Combat Style
Mordryth excels at:
- Forcing enemies to focus on him  
- Absorbing damage no one else could survive  
- Controlling space with caltrops and positioning  
- Standing firm in narrow passes, tunnels, and choke points  
- Protecting vulnerable casters and archers  

He is the wall that enemies break themselves against.

## Relationships
Mordryth’s closest bond is with his twin brother **Vyr**—a relationship defined by shared purpose, shared scars, and a lifetime of fighting side by side. His protective instincts extend to the entire Last Watch, especially Lanyssa and Cylena.

To Mordryth, the Watch is more than a unit.  
They are his family.
