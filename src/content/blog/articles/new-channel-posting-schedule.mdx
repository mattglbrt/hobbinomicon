Here's the new weekly posting schedule for the channel. Each day has a dedicated theme to help keep me a little more organized than I have been, especially as this thing has evolved. 

This will keep some variety and allow me to keep the vlog style with some videos but hopefully crank out some more polished ones too.

| Day | Category | Content Type |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| **Monday** | Painting Tutorial | Polished how-to videos (NMM, glazing, recipes) |
| **Tuesday** | Flex/Wildcard | Whatever is inspiring me at the time |
| **Wednesday** | WIP Wednesday | Informal painting, project updates, behind the scenes |
| **Thursday** | RPG & Narrative | Kingdom Death, Dolmenwood, things like that |
| **Friday** | Freebie Friday | Free downloads, STL files, resources, guides, giveaways |
| **Saturday** | Game Dev Journal development, design updates, playtesting |
| **Sunday** | Battle Reports | Game recaps, match summaries, event coverage |

If you made it this far you can see that there are some exciting things in the schedule. I also want to add that I plan on dropping a ton of Kingdom Death Monster videos, so expect a lot of double video drop days for the near future. 

Every Friday I want to release something to give back to the community. Whether that's a free STL of something I have sculpted, which is probably a few weeks off still, or some free asset or guide, or a giveaway. Just something that I can somehow give back to the community that I love so much.

I have also taken the plunge and started tinkering around with creating my own TTRPG to play with my kids, and I will be dropping everything I come up with for that for free right here on the website. My plan is to simplify Dungeons and Dragons enough that my kids can play it and we can use generic building bricks at the table.
