# 📚 Hobbinomicon Markdown Style Guide

**Purpose:**  
Keep all game descriptions, how-to-play sections, and key features formatted consistently and cleanly across the site.

---

## ✍️ General Rules

- Use **plain Markdown syntax** (no HTML).
- Keep formatting clean, minimal, and readable.
- Write in a professional but welcoming tone.

---

## 🍿️ Headers

- **Use only `##` for section headers**.
- Leave one blank line before and after a header.

```markdown
## How to Play

Warmachine uses a turn-based system where players alternate activating units...
```

---

## 🔹 Lists

- Use **dash (`-`)** for bullet points.
- One space after the dash.

```markdown
## Key Features

- Control powerful warcasters and steam-powered warjacks
- Manage focus points for tactical advantages
- Build and customize armies with deep faction lore
```

---

## 📝 Paragraphs and Line Breaks

- Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
- No manual `<br>` tags — let Markdown handle spacing naturally.

```markdown
Warmachine is set in the steam-powered Iron Kingdoms.

Players take command of mighty armies led by battle-hardened warcasters.
```

---

## 🔗 Links

- Format links as `[Link Text](URL)` without extra formatting.

```markdown
Learn more at the [official website](https://steamforged.com/pages/iron-kingdoms-warmachine).
```

---

## 🎨 Text Emphasis

- Use **bold** (`**bold text**`) for important points.
- Avoid italics unless necessary for emphasis.

```markdown
Warmachine is a game of **epic battles** and **tactical mastery**.
```

---

## ⚡ Special Notes

- **No emojis** in database entries.
- **Avoid giant walls of text** — use headers and lists.
- **Avoid first-person language** unless quoting.
