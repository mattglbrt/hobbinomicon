## The Campaign

Dolmenwood is a dark fairy tale setting where the mundane world brushes against realms of wonder and terror. Ancient forests hide secrets older than memory, and those who walk beneath their boughs often find themselves changed by the experience.

This campaign uses the **Dolmenwood** rule system, which is based on Old School Essentials but has evolved into its own distinct game with unique classes, magic, and mechanics tailored to the setting.

## The Setting

The Forest of Ruhar is part of my homebrew world, the Fractured Isles. It stretches across the land like a living thing, its boundaries shifting with the seasons and the moods of the fey who dwell within. Villages cling to its edges, their inhabitants telling tales of lights in the woods and travelers who venture too deep and never return.

Deep within the forest lies a portal to **Dolmenwood** itself—that strange and wondrous realm where fairy tales turn dark and ancient powers stir beneath moss-covered stones. Those who pass through find themselves in a world that feels familiar yet deeply wrong, where the rules of reality bend to the whims of forces older than memory.

The forest calls to those with restless hearts. Adventurers, scholars, and seekers of all kinds find themselves drawn to its mysteries, compelled by dreams they cannot explain or secrets they cannot ignore.

## The Story So Far

A group of unlikely companions has been drawn together in the heart of the forest. Each carries their own burden, their own purpose, their own hidden truth. What began as chance encounters may prove to be something far more deliberate—threads woven by forces beyond mortal understanding.
