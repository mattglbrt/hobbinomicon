## A Fateful Convergence

The Forest of Ruhar stretches ancient and unknowable beneath an autumn sky. Mist clings to the roots of towering oaks, and the air carries the scent of moss and something older, something that watches.

In a sunlit clearing, two unlikely figures have found each other. Thorek Duskworn, a dwarf who lost his faith and found something deeper within himself, kneels beside Rollo, a small Svirfneblin who climbed from the depths of the earth seeking the light he had only dreamed of. Their meeting was chance or perhaps by design.

Not far away, another group moves through the trees. Eloryn Vale leads the way, a scholar with too many books and a voice that suggests dusty libraries, though his eyes hold calculations he shares with no one. Behind him walks Garrin Vosk, a former soldier drifting through life with his hound Barrow at his heel. And somewhere nearby, never quite where you expect her, Triste dances through the branches.

She arranged this expedition. She always does.

## The Meeting

When the two groups encounter each other in the clearing, the forest seems to hold its breath. Barrow's ears prick forward. Rollo gazes at the newcomers with wide, wondering eyes. Thorek's hand drifts toward his weapon before he catches something in Triste's calm expression. Recognition, perhaps, or the sense that this meeting was always meant to happen.

Eloryn steps forward with a scholar's smile, already calculating how these strangers might serve his hidden purpose.

> The world has fractured, and the pieces are beginning to find each other.

What draws them deeper into the Forest of Ruhar? What secrets lie buried beneath the ancient trees? And what price will each of them pay before the journey ends?

The story begins.
