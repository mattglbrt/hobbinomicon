I have decided to take the plunge and finally start sharing my game development ideas. I, like probably everyone else in this hobby, have long dreamed of making my own game. For years I have started and half-assed making my own thing. I have notebooks and notebooks of work, gigs and gigs of files, and halfway finished attempts.

Today I am making the commitment to actually make something, get it across the finish line, and share it out with the world. So to start, I need to say:

> *This game is an independent work and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the LEGO Group. LEGO® is a trademark of the LEGO Group, which does not authorize, sponsor, or endorse this product.*

With that out of the way, my plan is to create a tabletop roleplaying game that I can play with my kids, ages 4-6, and have a good time. The ruleset will be M.I.N.I.S. agnostic so you can use whatever you have. We will be using what I like to call MINIS:

- **M**odular
- **I**nterlocking
- **N**arrative
- **I**con
- **S**ystem

If you don't have any MINIS, you can use your boring Warhammer figures, as everything will be based on base size.

There's a lot of punnery and tomfoolery going on there.
