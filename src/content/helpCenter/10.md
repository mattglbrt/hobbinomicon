## Resetting Your Password

If you’ve forgotten your password or need to change it for any reason, we’ve made it simple to reset it. Just follow the steps below to get back into your account.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Go to the Login Page**:  
   Head to the [login page](#) of our website where you usually sign in.

2. **Click on 'Forgot Password'**:  
   Beneath the password input field, you’ll see a link that says **Forgot Password?**. Click on it to begin the reset process.

3. **Enter Your Email Address**:  
   You’ll be asked to enter the email address associated with your account. Make sure it’s the correct one, then click **Submit**.

4. **Check Your Email for a Reset Link**:  
   After submitting your email, you’ll receive a message with a password reset link. Check your inbox and follow the instructions in the email.

5. **Reset Your Password**:  
   Once you click the reset link, you’ll be directed to a page where you can enter a new password. Make sure it’s strong and different from your previous password. 

6. **Save Your New Password**:  
   After entering your new password, click **Save**. You’ll receive a confirmation that your password has been successfully changed.

### Common Issues & Solutions

- **I didn’t receive the password reset email**:  
   Check your spam or junk folder. If it’s not there, try again or make sure the email address you entered is correct.

- **The reset link expired**:  
   Reset links are only valid for a short period of time. If your link expired, simply go back to the login page and request a new one.

- **I still can’t log in after resetting my password**:  
   If you’ve reset your password but still can’t access your account, try clearing your browser’s cache and cookies. You can also try logging in on a different device or browser.
