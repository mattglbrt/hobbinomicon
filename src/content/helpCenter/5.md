### Steps to reset your password

1. **Go to the login page**: On the homepage, click **"Login"** in the top right corner to go to the login page.
2. **Click 'Forgot Password'**: Below the password field, you’ll see a **"Forgot Password?"** link. Click on it.
3. **Enter your email address**: On the next page, enter the email address associated with your account and click **"Send Reset Link"**.
4. **Check your email**: We’ll send you a password reset link to your email address. Open the email and click the link.

6. **Confirm your new password**: After entering your new password, click **"Reset Password"** to confirm.

### Tips for creating a strong password
