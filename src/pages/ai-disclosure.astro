  <LegalSection title="My Commitment to Transparency">
    <p class="text-ink/80 dark:text-ink-dark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The Hobbinomicon is a one-person operation, and I believe in being transparent about how I create and maintain my content. This page explains my use of artificial intelligence tools and reaffirms my commitment to authentic, human-created content.
    </p>

  <LegalSection title="What Is 100% Human-Created">
    <p class="text-ink/80 dark:text-ink-dark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      <strong>All creative content on this website is created entirely by me:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 text-ink/80 dark:text-ink-dark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Written Content:</strong> All blog posts, tutorials, guides, reviews, and articles are written by me. Every word, opinion, and idea comes from genuine human experience and creativity.</li>
      <li><strong>Images & Photography:</strong> All photographs, painted miniatures, and visual content are captured and created by me. No AI-generated images are used.</li>
      <li><strong>Videos:</strong> All YouTube videos are filmed, edited, and produced by me.</li>
      <li><strong>Artwork:</strong> Any original artwork or illustrations are human-created.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-ink/80 dark:text-ink-dark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      When you read a tutorial, watch a video, or look at photos of my painted miniatures, you're experiencing genuine human creativity and craftsmanship.

  <LegalSection title="How I Use AI Tools">
    <p class="text-ink/80 dark:text-ink-dark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      I do use AI tools in limited, behind-the-scenes capacities to help maintain and improve the website:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 text-ink/80 dark:text-ink-dark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Website Development:</strong> AI coding assistants help with programming tasks, debugging, and implementing new features on the website.</li>
      <li><strong>Site Organization:</strong> AI tools assist with organizing content, optimizing site performance, and maintaining the technical infrastructure.</li>
      <li><strong>Code Review:</strong> AI helps review and improve the codebase that powers this website.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-ink/80 dark:text-ink-dark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Think of it like using a power tool instead of a hand tool - the AI helps with the technical construction of the website, but the creative vision, content, and craftsmanship remain entirely human.
    </p>

  <LegalSection title="Why This Matters">
    <p class="text-ink/80 dark:text-ink-dark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      In an era where AI-generated content is becoming increasingly common, I believe it's important to be upfront about what's human-made and what isn't. The hobby community deserves to know that the tutorials, reviews, and content they're consuming come from real experience and genuine passion for the hobby.
    </p>
    <p class="text-ink/80 dark:text-ink-dark/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      When I share a painting technique, it's because I've actually used it. When I review a product, I've actually tried it. When I show a finished miniature, I've actually painted it. That authenticity is something I'll never compromise.
